For each elixir, roll on the Experimental Elixir table for the elixir\u2019s effect, which is triggered when someone drinks the elixir. The elixir appears in a vial, and the vial vanishes when the elixir is drunk or poured out. If any elixir remains when you finish a Long Rest, the elixir and its vial vanish.\nDrinking an Elixir. As a Bonus Action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to another creature within 5 feet of itself.\nCreating Additional Elixirs. As a Magic action while holding Alchemist\u2019s Supplies, you can expend one spell slot to create another elixir. When you do so, you choose its effect from the Experimental Elixir table rather than rolling.\nWhen you reach certain Artificer levels, you can make an additional elixir at the end of each Long Rest: a total of three at level 5, four at level 9, and five at level 15.\nExperimental Elixir\n\n\nD6\nEffect\n\n\n1\nHealing.

That roll must restore Hit Points or be a damage roll that deals Acid, Fire, or Poison damage. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum bonus of \u002B1).\nLevel 9: Restorative Reagents\nYou can cast Lesser Restoration without expending a spell slot and without preparing the spell, provided you use Alchemist\u2019s Supplies as the Spellcasting Focus. You can do so a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 15: Chemical Mastery\nYou gain the following benefits.\nAlchemical Eruption.

The armor continues to be Arcane Armor until you don another suit of armor or you die.\nYou gain the following benefits while wearing your Arcane Armor.\nNo Strength Requirement. If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the Arcane Armor lacks this requirement for you.\nQuick Don and Doff. You can don or doff the armor as a Utilize action. The armor can\u2019t be removed against your will.\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use the Arcane Armor as a Spellcasting Focus for your Artificer spells.\nLevel 3: Armor Model\nYou can customize your Arcane Armor. When you do so, choose one of the following armor models: Dreadnaught, Guardian, or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives you special benefits while you wear it.\nEach model includes a special weapon. When you attack with that weapon, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, to the attack and damage rolls.\nYou can change the armor\u2019s model whenever you finish a Short or Long Rest if you have Smith\u2019s Tools in hand.\nDreadnaught.\nYou design your armor to become a towering juggernaut in battle. It has the following features:\nForce Demolisher. An arcane wrecking ball or sledgehammer projects from your armor. The demolisher counts as a Simple Melee weapon with the Reach property, and it deals 1d10 Force damage on a hit. If you hit a creature that is at least one size smaller than you with the demolisher, you can push the creature up to 10 feet straight away from yourself or pull the creature up to 10 feet toward yourself.\nGiant Stature. As a Bonus Action, you transform and enlarge your armor for 1 minute. For the duration, your reach increases by 5 feet, and if you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If there isn\u2019t enough room for you to increase your size, your size doesn\u2019t change. You can use this Bonus Action a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\nGuardian.\nYou design your armor to be in the front line of conflict. It has the following features:\nThunder Pulse. You can discharge concussive blasts with strikes from your armor. The pulse counts as a Simple Melee weapon and deals 1d8 Thunder damage on a hit. A creature hit by the pulse has Disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn.\nDefensive Field. While Bloodied, you can take a Bonus Action to gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your Artificer level. You lose these Temporary Hit Points if you doff the armor.\nInfiltrator.\nYou customize your armor for subtler undertakings. It has the following features:\nLightning Launcher. A gemlike node appears on your armor, from which you can shoot bolts of lightning. The launcher counts as a Simple Ranged weapon with a normal range of 90 feet and a long range of 300 feet, and it deals 1d6 Lightning damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with the launcher, you can deal an extra 1d6 Lightning damage to that target.\nPowered Steps. Your Speed increases by 5 feet.\nDampening Field. You have Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If the armor imposes Disadvantage on such checks, the Advantage and Disadvantage cancel each other, as normal.\nLevel 5: Extra Attack\nYou can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nLevel 9: Improved Armorer\nYou gain the following benefits.\nArmor Replication. You learn an additional plan for your Replicate Magic Item feature, and it must be in the Armor category. If you replace that plan, you must replace it with another Armor plan.\nIn addition, you can create an additional item with that feature, and the item must also be in the Armor category.\nImproved Arsenal. You gain a \u002B1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the special weapon of your Arcane Armor model.\nLevel 15: Perfected Armor\nYour Arcane Armor gains additional benefits based on its model, as detailed below.\nDreadnaught. The damage die of your Force Demolisher increases to 2d6 Force damage.\nIn addition, when you use your Giant Stature, your reach increases by 10 feet, your size can increase to Large or Huge (your choice), and you have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws for the duration.\nGuardian. The damage die of your Thunder Pulse increases to 1d10 Thunder damage.\nIn addition, when a Huge or smaller creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to magically force that creature to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, you pull the creature up to 25 feet directly toward you to an unoccupied space. If you pull the target to a space within 5 feet of yourself, you can make a melee weapon attack against it as part of this Reaction.\nYou can take this Reaction a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\nInfiltrator. The damage die of your Lightning Launcher increases to 2d6 Lightning damage. Any creature that takes Lightning damage from your Lightning Launcher glimmers with magical light until the start of your next turn. The glimmering creature sheds Dim Light in a 5-foot radius, and it has Disadvantage on attack rolls against you, as the light jolts it if it attacks you.\nAdditionally, as a Bonus Action, you can gain a Fly Speed equal to twice your Speed until the end of the current turn. You can take this Bonus Action a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\n"

You gain proficiency with Martial Ranged weapons.\nTool Proficiency. You gain proficiency with Woodcarver\u2019s Tools.

The cannon\u2019s game statistics appear below. You determine its appearance, including whether you carry it or not (and your choice of legs or wheels, for the latter). It disappears if it is reduced to 0 Hit Points or after 1 hour. You can dismiss it early as a Magic action.\nOnce you create a cannon, you can\u2019t do so again until you finish a Long Rest or expend a spell slot to create one. You can have only one cannon at a time and can\u2019t create one while you already have one.\n\n\nEldritch Cannon\n\n\nSmall or Tiny Object\n\n\nArmor Class: 18\n\n\nHit Points: 5 \u00D7 your Artificer level (casting Mending on the cannon restores 2d6 Hit Points to it)\n\n\nImmunities: Poison, Psychic\n\n\nActivate Cannon (Requires You to be within 60 Feet of the Cannon): As a Bonus Action, you order the cannon to use the Flamethrower, Force Ballista, or Protector option below; you can direct the cannon to move up to 15 feet before or after that option:\n\n\nFlamethrower: The cannon exhales fire in a 15-foot Cone. Each creature in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Flammable objects in the Cone that aren\u2019t being worn or carried start burning.\n\n\nForce Ballista: Make a ranged spell attack originating from the cannon at one creature or object within 120 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 Force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is pushed up to 5 feet away from the cannon.\n\n\nProtector: The cannon emits a burst of positive energy that grants itself and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of it a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).\n\n\nLevel 5: Arcane Firearm\nWhen you finish a Long Rest, you can use Woodcarver\u2019s Tools to carve special sigils into a Rod, Staff, Wand, or Martial Ranged weapon and thereby turn it into your Arcane Firearm. The sigils disappear from the object if you later carve them on a different item. The sigils otherwise last indefinitely.\nYou can use your Arcane Firearm as a Spellcasting Focus for your Artificer spells. When you cast an Artificer spell through the firearm, roll 1d8, and you gain a bonus to one of the spell\u2019s damage rolls equal to the number rolled.\nLevel 9: Explosive Cannon\nEvery Eldritch Cannon you create is now more destructive. You gain the following benefits.\nDetonate. When your cannon takes damage, you can take a Reaction to command the cannon to detonate if you are within 60 feet of it. Doing so destroys the cannon and forces each creature within 20 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 3d10 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.\nFirepower. The cannon\u2019s damage rolls and the number of Temporary Hit Points granted by Protector increase by 1d8.\nLevel 15: Fortified Position\nYou\u2019re a master at forming well-defended emplacements using your Eldritch Cannon. You gain the following benefits.\nDouble Firepower. You can now have two cannons at the same time, and you can create two with the same Magic action. (If you expend a spell slot to create the first cannon, you must expend another spell slot to create the second.) You can activate both of them with the same Bonus Action, ordering them to use the same activation option or different ones. You can\u2019t create a third cannon while you have two.\nShimmering Field Projection. You and your allies have Half Cover while within 10 feet of your Eldritch Cannon.\n"

After the target teleports, you can reduce its Speed to 0 until the end of the current turn.\nLevel 10: Battering Roots\nDuring your turn, your reach is 10 feet greater with any Melee weapon that has the Heavy or Versatile property, as tendrils of the World Tree extend from you.

Each creature teleports to an unoccupied space of your choice within 10 feet of your destination space.\n"

See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as an Eldritch Knight.\nCantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice from the Wizard spell list (see that class\u2019s section for its list). Ray of Frost and Shocking Grasp are recommended. Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Wizard spell list.\nWhen you reach Fighter level 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice.\nSpell Slots. The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1\u002B spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1\u002B. You prepare the list of level 1\u002B spells that are available for you to cast with this feature.

Burning Hands, Jump, and Shield are recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Fighter levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Wizard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you\u2019re a level 7 Fighter, your list of prepared spells can include five Wizard spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Wizard spell for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability.

You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a Short Rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.

You have Advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until you use this feature again.\nIf the creature drops to 0 Hit Points before the vow ends, you can transfer the vow to a different creature within 30 feet of yourself (no action required).\nLevel 7: Relentless Avenger\nYour supernatural focus helps you close off a foe\u0027s retreat. When you hit a creature with an Opportunity Attack, you can reduce the creature\u0027s Speed to 0 until the end of the current turn. You can then move up to half your Speed as part of the same Reaction. This movement doesn\u0027t provoke Opportunity Attacks.\nLevel 15: Soul of Vengeance\nImmediately after a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity hits or misses with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to make a melee attack against that creature if it\u0027s within range.\nLevel 20: Avenging Angel\nAs a Bonus Action, you gain the benefits below for 10 minutes or until you end them (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can\u0027t use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).\nFlight. You sprout spectral wings on your back and have a Fly Speed of 60 feet, and can hover.\nFrightful Aura. Whenever an enemy starts its turn in your Aura of Protection, that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against the Frightened creature have Advantage.\n"

These Rogues discover psionic power within themselves and channel it to do their roguish work. As a Soulknife your psionic abilities might have haunted you since childhood, revealing their full potential only as you experienced the stress of adventure. Or you might have sought out an order of psychic adepts and spent years learning how to manifest your power.\nLevel 3: Psionic Power\nYou harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. It is represented by your Psionic Energy Dice, which fuel certain powers you have from this subclass. The Soulknife Energy Dice table shows the number of these dice you have when you reach certain Rogue levels, and the table shows the die size.\nSoulknife Energy Dice\n\n\nRogue Level\nDie Size\nNumber\n\n\n3\nD6\n4\n\n\n5\nD8\n6\n\n\n9\nD8\n8\n\n\n11\nD10\n8\n\n\n13\nD10\n10\n\n\n17\nD12\n12\n\n\nAny features in this subclass that use a Psionic Energy Die use only the dice from this subclass. Some of your powers expend a Psionic Energy Die, as specified in the power\u0027s description, and you can\u0027t use the power if it requires you to use a die when your Psionic Energy Dice are all expended.\nYou regain one of your expended Psionic Energy Dice when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all of them when you finish a Long Rest.\nPsi-Bolstered Knack. If you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with which you have proficiency, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the check, potentially turning failure into success. The die is expended only if the roll then succeeds.\nPsychic Whispers. You can establish telepathic communication between yourself and others. As a Magic action, choose one or more creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and then roll one Psionic Energy Die. For a number of hours equal to the number rolled, the chosen creatures can speak telepathically to you, and you can speak telepathically with them. To send or receive a message (no action required), you and the other creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A creature can end the telepathic connection at any time (no action required).\nLevel 3: Psychic Blades\nYou can manifest shimmering blades of psychic energy. Whenever you take the Attack action or make an Opportunity Attack, you can manifest a Psychic Blade in your free hand and make the attack with that blade. The magic blade has the following traits:\nWeapon Category: Simple Melee\nDamage on a Hit: 1d6 Psychic plus the ability modifier used for the attack roll\nProperties: Finesse, Thrown (range 60/120 feet)\nMastery: Vex (you can use this property, and it doesn\u0027t count against the number of properties you can use with Weapon Mastery)\nThe blade vanishes immediately after it hits or misses its target, and it leaves no mark if it deals damage.\nAfter you attack with the blade on your turn, you can make a melee or ranged attack with a second psychic blade as a Bonus Action on the same turn if your other hand is free to create it. The damage die of this bonus attack is 1d4 instead of 1d6.\nLevel 9: Soul Blades\nYou can now use the following powers with your Psychic Blades.\nHoming Strikes. If you make an attack roll with your Psychic Blade and miss the target, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the attack roll. If this causes the attack to hit, the die is expended.\nPsychic Teleportation. As a Bonus Action, you manifest a Psychic Blade, expend one Psionic Energy Die and roll it, and throw the blade at an unoccupied space you can see up to a number of feet away equal to 10 times the number rolled. You then teleport to that space, and the blade vanishes.\nLevel 13: Psychic Veil\nYou can weave a veil of psychic static to mask yourself. As a Magic action, you gain the Invisible condition for 1 hour or until you dismiss the effect (no action required). This invisibility ends early immediately after you deal damage to a creature or you force a creature to make a saving throw.\nOnce you use this feature, you can\u0027t do so again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.\nLevel 17: Rend Mind\nYou can sweep your Psychic Blades through a creature\u0027s mind. When you use you Psychic Blades to deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you can force that target to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus). If the save fails, the target has the Stunned condition for 1 minute. The Stunned target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.\nOnce you use this feature, you can\u0027t do so again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend three Psionic Energy Dice (no action required) to restore your use of it.\n"

On a roll of 6, you use the property without expending the charges.\nScrolls. You can use any Spell Scroll, using Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for the spell.

If the scroll contains a higher-level spell, you must first succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10 plus the spell\u0027s level). On a successful check, you cast the spell from the scroll. On a failed check, the scroll disintegrates.\nLevel 17: Thief\u0027s Reflexes\nYou are adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal Initiative and your second turn at your Initiative minus 10.\n"

Or will you be a terror to those who feel the stab of your mind?\nPerhaps a psychic wind from the Astral Plane carried psionic energy to you, or you were exposed to the Far Realm\u2019s warping influence. Alternatively, you were implanted with a mind flayer tadpole, but your transformation into a mind flayer never occurred; now the tadpole\u2019s psionic power is yours. However you acquired this power, your mind is aflame with it.\nLevel 3: Psionic Spells\nWhen you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Psionic Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.\nPsionic Spells\n\n\nSorcerer Level\nSpells\n\n\n3\nArms of Hadar, Calm Emotions, Detect Thoughts, Dissonant Whispers, Mind Sliver\n\n\n5\nHunger of Hadar, Sending\n\n\n7\nEvard\u0027s Black Tentacles, Summon Aberration\n\n\n9\nRary\u0027s Telepathic Bond, Telekinesis\n\n\nLevel 3: Telepathic Speech\nYou can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another.

To understand each other, you each must mentally use a language the other knows.\nThe telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Sorcerer level. It ends early if you use this ability to form a connection with a different creature.\nLevel 6: Psionic Sorcery\nWhen you cast any level 1\u002B spell from your Psionic Spells feature, you can cast it by expending a spell slot as normal or by spending a number of Sorcery Points equal to the spell\u2019s level. If you cast the spell using Sorcery Points, it requires no Verbal or Somatic components, and it requires no Material components unless they are consumed by the spell or have a cost specified in it.\nLevel 6: Psychic Defenses\nYou have Resistance to Psychic damage, and you have Advantage on saving throws to avoid or end the Charmed or Frightened condition.\nLevel 14: Revelation in Flesh\nYou can unleash the aberrant truth hidden within yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point or more to magically alter your body for 10 minutes.

As a Magic action, you teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of yourself. Immediately after you disappear, each creature within 30 feet of the space you left must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d10 Force damage and is pulled straight toward the space you left, ending in an unoccupied space as close to your former space as possible. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.\nOnce you use this feature, you can\u2019t do so again until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 5 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.\n"

As a Magic action, you can expend 1 to 5 Sorcery Points to create a magical ward around yourself or another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself.

When you cast a cantrip at a creature and you miss with the attack roll or the target succeeds on a saving throw against the cantrip, the target takes half the cantrip\u2019s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.\nLevel 6: Sculpt Spells\nYou can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocations. When you cast an Evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 plus the spell\u0027s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.\nLevel 10: Empowered Evocation\nWhenever you cast a Wizard spell from the Evocation school, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of that spell.\nLevel 14: Overchannel\nYou can increase the power of your spells.

The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates.\nOnce you use this feature, you can\u0027t use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

When you cast an Illusion spell with a spell slot, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a Bonus Action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute, during which it can\u0027t deal damage or give any conditions. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real and cross it.\n"
