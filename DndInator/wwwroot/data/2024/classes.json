See the Player\u2019s Handbook for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Artificer spells, which appear in the Artificer Spell List\nTools Required. You produce your Artificer spells through tools. You can use Thieves\u2019 Tools, Tinker\u2019s Tools, or another kind of Artisan\u2019s Tools with which you have proficiency as a Spellcasting Focus, and you must have one of those focuses in hand when you cast an Artificer spell (meaning the spell has an M component when you cast it).\nCantrips. You know two Artificer cantrips of your choice. Acid Splash and Prestidigitation are recommended.\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Artificer cantrip of your choice.\nWhen you reach Artificer levels 10 and 14, you learn another Artificer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Artificer Features table.\nSpell Slots. The Artificer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1\u002B spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1\u002B. You prepare the list of level 1\u002B spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Artificer spells. Cure Wounds and Grease are recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Artificer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Artificer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Artificer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you\u2019re a level 5 Artificer, your list of prepared spells can include six Artificer spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\nIf another Artificer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those don\u2019t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Artificer spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Artificer spells for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Artificer spells.\nLevel 1: Tinker\u0027s Magic \nYou know the Mending cantrip.\nAs a Magic action while holding Tinker\u2019s Tools, you can create one item in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of yourself, choosing the item from the following list:\n\n\nBall Bearings\nFlask\nPouch\n\n\nBasket\nGrappling Hook\nRope\n\n\nBedroll\nHunting Trap\nSack\n\n\nBell\nJug\nShovel\n\n\nBlanket\nLamp\nSpikes, Iron\n\n\nBlock and Tackle\nManacles\nString\n\n\nBottle, Glass\nNet\nTinderbox\n\n\nBucket\nOil\nTorch\n\n\nCaltrops\nPaper\nVial\n\n\nCandle\nParchment\n\n\n\nCrowbar\nPole\n\n\n\nSee the rules for the item in the Player\u2019s Handbook. The item lasts until you finish a Long Rest, at which point it vanishes.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 2: Replicate Magic Item \nYou have learned arcane plans that you use to make magic items.\nPlans Known. When you gain this feature, choose four plans to learn from the Magic Item Plans (Artificer Level 2\u002B) table. Bag of Holding, Cap of Water Breathing, Sending Stones, and Wand of the War Mage are recommended. Whenever you gain an Artificer level, you can replace one of the plans you know with a new plan for which you qualify.\nYou learn another plan of your choice when you reach certain Artificer levels, as shown in the Plans Known column of the Artificer Features table. When you choose a plan to learn, you choose it from any Magic Item Plans table for which you qualify; your qualification is based on your Artificer level.\nCreating an Item. When you finish a Long Rest, you can create one or two different magic items if you have Tinker\u2019s Tools in hand. Each item is based on one of the plans you know for this feature.\nIf a created item requires Attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you create it. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for Attunement.\nWhen you reach certain Artificer levels specified in the Magic Items column of the Artificer Features table, the number of magic items you can create at the end of a Long Rest increases. Each item you create must be based on a different plan you know.\nYou can\u2019t have more magic items from this feature than the number shown in the Magic Items column of the Artificer Features table for your level. If you try to exceed your maximum number of magic items for this feature, the oldest item vanishes, and then the new item appears.\nDuration. A magic item created by this feature functions as the normal magic item, except its magic isn\u2019t permanent; when you die, the magic item vanishes after 1d4 days. If you replace a plan you know with a new plan, any magic item created with the replaced plan immediately vanishes.\nIf an item that you created with this feature is a container, such as a Bag of Holding, and it vanishes, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use any Wand or Weapon created by this feature as a Spellcasting Focus in lieu of using a set of Artisan\u2019s Tools.\nMagic Item Plans (Artificer Level 2\u002B)\n\n\nMagic Item Plan\nAttunement\n\n\nAlchemy Jug\nNo\n\n\nBag of Holding\nNo\n\n\nCap of Water Breathing\nNo\n\n\nCommon magic item that isn\u2019t a Potion, a Scroll, or cursed (you can learn this option multiple times and must select a different item each time; each item selected counts as a different plan)\nVaries\n\n\nGoggles of Night\nNo\n\n\nManifold Tool\nYes\n\n\nRepeating Shot\nYes\n\n\nReturning Weapon\nNo\n\n\nRope of Climbing\nNo\n\n\nSending Stones\nNo\n\n\nShield \u002B1\nNo\n\n\nWand of Magic Detection\nNo\n\n\nWand of Secrets\nNo\n\n\nWand of the War Mage \u002B1\nYes\n\n\nWeapon \u002B1\nNo\n\n\nWraps of Unarmed Power \u002B1\nNo\n\n\nMagic Item Plans (Artificer Level 6\u002B)\n\n\nMagic Item Plan\nAttunement\n\n\nArmor \u002B1\nNo\n\n\nBoots of Elvenkind\nNo\n\n\nBoots of the Winding Path\nYes\n\n\nCloak of Elvenkind\nYes\n\n\nCloak of the Manta Ray\nNo\n\n\nDazzling Weapon\nYes\n\n\nEyes of Charming\nYes\n\n\nEyes of Minute Seeing\nNo\n\n\nGloves of Thievery\nNo\n\n\nHelm of Awareness\nNo\n\n\nLantern of Revealing\nNo\n\n\nMind Sharpener\nYes\n\n\nNecklace of Adaption\nYes\n\n\nPipes of Haunting\nNo\n\n\nRepulsion Shield\nNo\n\n\nRing of Swimming\nNo\n\n\nRing of Water Walking\nNo\n\n\nSentinel Shield\nNo\n\n\nSpell-Refueling Ring\nYes\n\n\nWand of Magic Missiles\nNo\n\n\nWand of Web\nYes\n\n\nWeapon of Warning\nYes\n\n\nMagic Item Plans (Artificer Level 10\u002B)\n\n\nMagic Item Plan\nAttunement\n\n\nArmor of Resistance\nYes\n\n\nDagger of Venom\nNo\n\n\nElven Chain\nNo\n\n\nRing of Feather Falling\nYes\n\n\nRing of Jumping\nYes\n\n\nRing of Mind Shielding\nYes\n\n\nShield \u002B2\nNo\n\n\nUncommon Wondrous Item that isn\u2019t cursed (you can learn this option multiple times and must select a different item each time; each item selected counts as a different plan)\nVaries\n\n\nWand of the War Mage \u002B2\nYes\n\n\nWeapon \u002B2\nNo\n\n\nWraps of Unarmed Power \u002B2\nNo\n\n\nMagic Item Plans (Artificer Level 14\u002B)\n\n\nMagic Item Plan\nAttunement\n\n\nArmor \u002B2\nNo\n\n\nArrow-Catching Shield\nYes\n\n\nFlame Tongue\nYes\n\n\nRare Wondrous Item that isn\u2019t cursed (you can learn this option multiple times and must select a different item each time; each item selected counts as a different plan)\nVaries\n\n\nRing of Free Action\nYes\n\n\nRing of Protection\nYes\n\n\nRing of the Ram\nYes\n\n\nLevel 3: Artificer Subclass \nYou gain an Artificer subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Artificer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass\u2019s features that are of your Artificer level or lower.\nArtificer Subclasses\n    \n\n\n\nName\n\n\nAlchemist\n\n\nArmorer\n\n\nArtillerist\n\n\nBattle Smith\n\n\nCartographer\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \nLevel 4: Ability Score Improvement \nYou gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Artificer levels 8, 12, and 16.\nLevel 6: Magic Item Tinker \nYour Replicate Magic Item feature gains the following options.\nCharge Magic Item. As a Bonus Action, you can touch a magic item within 5 feet of yourself that you created with Replicate Magic Item and that uses charges. You expend a level 1\u002B spell slot and recharge the item. The number of charges the item regains is equal to the level of spell slot expended.\nDrain Magic Item. As a Bonus Action, you can touch a magic item within 5 feet of yourself that you created with Replicate Magic Item and cause the item to vanish, converting its magical energy into a spell slot. The slot is level 1 if the item is Common or level 2 if the item is Uncommon or Rare. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t do so again until you finish a Long Rest. Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a Long Rest.\nTransmute Magic Item. As a Magic action, you can touch one magic item within 5 feet of yourself that you created with Replicate Magic Item and transform it into a different magic item. The resulting item must be based on a magic item plan you know. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 7: Flash of Genius \nWhen you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you fails an ability check or a saving throw, you can take a Reaction to add a bonus to the roll, potentially causing it to succeed. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of \u002B1).\nYou can take this Reaction a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 10: Magic Item Adept \nYou can now attune to up to four magic items at once.\nLevel 11: Spell-Storing Item \nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can touch one Simple or Martial weapon or one item that you can use as a Spellcasting Focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a level 1, 2, or 3 Artificer spell that has a casting time of an action and doesn\u2019t require a Material component that is consumed by the spell (you needn\u2019t have the spell prepared).\nWhile holding the object, a creature can take a Magic action to produce the spell\u2019s effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires Concentration, the creature must concentrate. Once a creature has used the object to produce the spell\u2019s effect, the object can\u2019t be used this way again until the start of the creature\u2019s next turn.\nThe spell stays in the object until it\u2019s been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object.\nLevel 14: Advanced Artifice \nYou gain the following benefits.\nMagic Item Savant. You can now attune to up to five magic items at once.\nRefreshed Genius. When you finish a Short Rest, you regain one expended use of your Flash of Genius feature.\nLevel 18: Magic Item Master \nYou can now attune to up to six magic items at once.\nLevel 19: Epic Boon \nYou gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Energy Resistance is recommended.\nLevel 20: Soul of Artifice \nYou have developed a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for aid. You gain the following benefits.\nCheat Death. If you\u2019re reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed outright, you can disintegrate any number of Uncommon or Rare magic items created by your Replicate Magic Item feature. If you do so, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to 20 times the number of magic items disintegrated.\nMagical Guidance. When you finish a Short Rest, you regain all expended uses of your Flash of Genius if you have Attunement to at least one magic item.\n"

These features are listed in the Barbarian Features table.\nLevel 1: Rage \nYou can imbue yourself with a primal power called Rage, a force that grants you extraordinary might and resilience. You can enter it as a Bonus Action if you aren\u0027t wearing Heavy armor.\nYou can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian Features table. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\nWhile active, your Rage follows the rules below.\nDamage Resistance. You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.\nRage Damage. When you make an attack using Strength\u2014with either a weapon or an Unarmed Strike\u2014and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian Features table.\nStrength Advantage. You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.\nNo Concentration or Spells. You can\u0027t maintain Concentration, and you can\u0027t cast spells.\nDuration. The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following:\n\nMake an attack roll against an enemy.\nForce an enemy to make a saving throw.\nTake a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.\n\nEach time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes.\nLevel 1: Unarmored Defense \nWhile you aren\u0027t wearing any armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.\nLevel 1: Weapon Mastery \nYour training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of Simple or Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Greataxes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.\nWhen you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Barbarian Features table.\nLevel 2: Danger Sense \nYou gain an uncanny sense of when things aren\u0027t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge perils. You have Advantage on Dexterity saving throws unless you have the Incapacitated condition.\nLevel 2: Reckless Attack \nYou can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with increased ferocity. When you make your first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you Advantage on attack rolls using Strength until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against you have Advantage during that time.\nLevel 3: Barbarian Subclass \nYou gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. The Path of the Berserker, Path of the Wild Heart, Path of the World Tree, and Path of the Zealot subclasses are detailed after this class\u2019s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass\u2019s features that are of\nyour Barbarian level or lower.\nBarbarian Subclasses\n    \n\n\n\nName\n\n\nPath Of The Berserker\n\n\nPath Of The Wild Heart\n\n\nPath Of The World Tree\n\n\nPath Of The Zealot\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \nLevel 3: Primal Knowledge \nYou gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the skill list available to Barbarians at level 1.\nIn addition, while your Rage is active, you can channel primal power when you attempt certain tasks; whenever you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception, Stealth, or Survival. When you use this ability, your Strength represents primal power coursing through you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.\nLevel 4: Ability Score Improvement \nYou gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.\nLevel 5: Extra Attack \nYou can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nLevel 5: Fast Movement \nYour speed increases by 10 feet while you aren\u0027t wearing Heavy armor.\nLevel 7: Feral Instinct \nYour instincts are so honed that you have Advantage on Initiative rolls.\nLevel 7: Instinctive Pounce \nAs part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your Rage, you can move up to half your Speed.\nLevel 9: Brutal Strike \nIf you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any Advantage on one Strength-based attack roll of your choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn\u0027t have Disadvantage. If the chosen attack roll hits, the target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon or Unarmed Strike, and you can cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice.\nYou have the following effect options.\nForceful Blow. The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then move up to half your Speed straight toward the target without provoking Opportunity Attacks.\nHamstring Blow. The target\u2019s Speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time\u2014 the most recent one.\nLevel 11: Relentless Rage \nYour Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage is active and don\u0027t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to twice your Barbarian level.\nEach time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short or Long Rest, the DC resets to 10.\nLevel 13: Improved Brutal Strike \nYou have honed new ways to attack furiously. The following effects are now among your Brutal Strike options.\nStaggering Blow. The target has Disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes, and it can\u2019t make Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next turn.\nSundering Blow. Before the start of your next turn, the next attack roll made by another creature against the target gains a \u002B5 bonus to the roll. An attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus.\nLevel 15: Persistent Rage \nWhen you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage in this way, you can\u2019t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\nIn addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends early if you have the Unconscious condition (not just the Incapacitated condition) or don Heavy armor.\nLevel 17: Improved Brutal Strike \nThe extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to 2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike feature.\nLevel 18: Indomitable Might \nIf your total for a Strength check or Strength saving throw is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.\nLevel 19: Epic Boon \nYou gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Irresistible Offense is recommended.\nLevel 20: Primal Champion \nYou embody primal power. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.\n"

These features are listed in the Bard Features table.\nLevel 1: Bardic Inspiration \nYou can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or dance. This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6.\nUsing Bardic Inspiration. As a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.\nOnce within the next hour when the creature fails a D20 Test, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it\u0027s rolled.\nNumber of Uses. You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\nAt Higher Levels. Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d10 at level 10, and a d12 at level 15.\nLevel 1: Spellcasting \nYou have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Bard spells, which appear in the Bard spell list later in the class\u0027s description.\nCantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list. Dancing Lights and Vicious Mockery are recommended.\nWhenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list.\nWhen you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard Features table.\nSpell Slots. The Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1\u002B spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1\u002B. You prepare the list of level 1\u002B spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Bard spell list. Charm Person, Color Spray, Dissonant Whispers, and Healing Word are recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you\u0027re a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\nIf another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don\u2019t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Bard spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.\nLevel 2: Expertise \nYou gain Expertise (see the rules glossary) in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice. Performance and Persuasion are recommended if you have proficiency in them.\nAt Bard level 9, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your choice.\nLevel 2: Jack of all Trades \nYou can add half your Proficiency Bonus (round down) to any ability check you make that uses a skill proficiency you lack and that doesn\u0027t otherwise use your Proficiency Bonus.\nFor example, if you make a Strength (Athletics) check and lack Athletics proficiency, you can add half your Proficiency Bonus to the check.\nLevel 3: Bard Subclass \nYou gain a Bard subclass of your choice. The College of Dance, College of Glamour, College of Lore, and College of Valor subclasses are detailed after this class\u0027s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Bard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass\u2019s features that are of your Bard level or lower.\nBard Subclasses\n    \n\n\n\nName\n\n\nCollege of Dance\n\n\nCollege of Glamour\n\n\nCollege of Lore\n\n\nCollege of the Moon\n\n\nCollege of Valor\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \nLevel 4: Ability Score Improvement \nYou gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Bard levels 8, 12, and 16.\nLevel 5: Font of Inspiration \nYou now regain all your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a Short or Long Rest.\nIn addition, you can expend a spell slot (no action required) to regain one expended use of Bardic Inspiration.\nLevel 7: Countercharm \nYou can use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. If you or a creature within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an effect that applies the Charmed or Frightened condition, you can take a Reaction to cause the save to be rerolled, and the new roll has Advantage.\nLevel 10: Magical Secrets \nYou\u0027ve learned secrets from various magical traditions. Whenever you reach a Bard level (including this level) and the Prepared Spells number in the Bard Features table increases, you can choose any of your new prepared spells from the Bard, Cleric, Druid, and Wizard spell lists, and the chosen spells count as Bard spells for you (see a class\u2019s section for its spell list). In addition, whenever you replace a spell prepared for this class, you can replace it with a spell from those lists.\nLevel 18: Superior Inspiration \nWhen you roll Initiative, you regain expended uses of Bardic Inspiration until you have two if you have fewer than that.\nLevel 19: Epic Boon \nYou gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Spell Recall is recommended.\nLevel 20: Words of Creation \nYou have mastered two of the Words of Creation: the words of life and death. You therefore always have the Power Word: Heal and Power Word: Kill spells prepared. When you cast either spell, you can target a second creature with it if that creature is within 10 feet of the first target.\n"

The Cleric Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1\u002B spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1\u002B. You prepare the list of level 1\u002B spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric spell list. Bless, Cure Wounds, Guiding Bolt, and Shield of Faith are recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you\u2019re a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\nIf another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don\u2019t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Cleric spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells.\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.\nLevel 1: Divine Order \nYou have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.\nProtector. Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Heavy armor.\nThaumaturge. You know one extra cantrip from the Cleric spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of \u002B1).\nLevel 2: Channel Divinity \nYou can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use this class\u2019s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels.\nYou can use this class\u2019s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features table.\nIf a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class\u2019s Spellcasting feature.\nDivine Spark. As a Magic action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down).\nYou roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).\nTurn Undead. As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its save, it has the Frightened and Incapacitated conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if you die.\nLevel 3: Cleric Subclass \nYou gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. The Life Domain, Light Domain, Trickery Domain, and War Domain subclasses are detailed after this class\u2019s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass\u2019s features that are of your Cleric level or lower.\nCleric Subclasses\n    \n\n\n\nName\n\n\nKnowledge Domain\n\n\nLife Domain\n\n\nLight Domain\n\n\nTrickery Domain\n\n\nWar Domain\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \nLevel 4: Ability Score Improvement \nYou gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels 8, 12, and 16.\nLevel 5: Sear Undead \nWhenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each Undead that fails its saving throw against that use of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the roll\u2019s total. This damage doesn\u2019t end the turn effect.\nLevel 7: Blessed Strikes \nDivine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of the following options of your choice (if you get either option from a Cleric subclass in an older book, use only the option you choose for this feature).\nDivine Strike. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice).\nPotent Spellcasting. Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip.\nLevel 10: Divine Intervention \nYou can call on your deity or pantheon to intervene on your behalf. As a Magic action, choose any Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn\u2019t require a Reaction to cast. As part of the same action, you cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing Material components. You can\u2019t use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 14: Improved Blessed Strikes \nThe option you chose for Blessed Strikes grows more powerful.\nDivine Strike. The extra damage of your Divine Strike increases to 2d8.\nPotent Spellcasting. When you cast a Cleric cantrip and deal damage to a creature with it, you can give vitality to yourself or another creature within 60 feet of yourself, granting a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to twice your Wisdom modifier.\nLevel 19: Epic Boon \nYou gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended.\nLevel 20: Greater Divine Intervention \nYou can call on even more powerful divine intervention. When you use your Divine Intervention feature, you can choose Wish when you select a spell. If you do so, you can\u2019t use Divine Intervention again until you finish 2d4 Long Rests.\n"

These features are listed in the Druid Features table.\nLevel 1: Spellcasting \nYou have learned to cast spells through studying the mystical forces of nature. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the Druid spell list later in the class\u2019s description.\nCantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list. Druidcraft and Produce Flame are recommended.\nWhenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list.\nWhen you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table.\nSpell Slots. The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1\u002B spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1\u002B. You prepare the list of level 1\u002B spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list. Animal Friendship, Cure Wounds, Faerie Fire, and Thunderwave are recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you\u2019re a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\nIf another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don\u2019t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.\nLevel 1: Druidic \nYou know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. While learning this ancient tongue, you also unlocked the magic of communicating with animals; you always have the Speak with Animals spell prepared.\nYou can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You and others who know Druidic automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message\u2019s presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check but can\u2019t decipher it without magic.\nLevel 1: Primal Order \nYou have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.\nMagician. You know one extra cantrip from the Druid spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to nature gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of \u002B1).\nWarden. Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor.\nLevel 2: Wild Shape \nThe power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see \u201CKnown Forms\u201D below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.\nNumber of Uses. You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\nYou gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table.\nKnown Forms. You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed (see appendix B for stat block options). The Rat, Riding Horse, Spider, and Wolf are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form.\nWhen you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.\nWhen choosing known forms, you may look in the Monster Manual or elsewhere for eligible Beasts if the Dungeon Master permits you to do so.\n\n\nDruid Level\nKnown Forms\nMax CR\nFly Speed\n\n\n2\n4\n1/4\nNo\n\n\n4\n6\n1/2\nNo\n\n\n8\n8\n1\nYes\n\n\nRules While Shape-Shifted. While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:\nTemporary Hit Points. When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid level.\nGame Statistics. Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast\u2019s stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast\u2019s stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.\nNo Spellcasting. You can\u2019t cast spells, but shape-shifting doesn\u2019t break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you\u2019ve already cast.\nObjects. Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form\u2019s limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it\u2019s practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature\u2019s size and shape. Your equipment doesn\u2019t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can\u2019t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you\u2019re in that form.\nLevel 2: Wild Companion \nYou can summon a nature spirit that assumes an animal form to aid you. As a Magic action, you can expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast the Find Familiar spell without Material components.\nWhen you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is Fey and disappears when you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 3: Druid Subclass \nYou gain a Druid subclass of your choice. The Circle of the Land, Circle of the Moon, Circle of the Sea, and Circle of the Stars subclasses are detailed after this class\u2019s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Druid levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass\u2019s features that are of your Druid level or lower.\nDruid Subclasses\n    \n\n\n\nName\n\n\nCircle of the Land\n\n\nCircle of the Moon\n\n\nCircle of the Sea\n\n\nCircle of the Stars\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \nLevel 4: Ability Score Improvement \nYou gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Druid levels 8, 12, and 16.\nLevel 5: Wild Resurgence \nOnce on each of your turns, if you have no uses of Wild Shape left, you can give yourself one use by expending a spell slot (no action required).\nIn addition, you can expend one use of Wild Shape (no action required) to give yourself a level 1 spell slot, but you can\u2019t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 7: Elemental Fury \nThe might of the elements flows through you. You gain one of the following options of your choice.\nPotent Spellcasting. Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Druid cantrip.\nPrimal Strike. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon or a Beast form\u2019s attack in Wild Shape, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (choose when you hit).\nLevel 15: Improved Elemental Fury \nThe option you chose for Elemental Fury grows more powerful, as detailed below.\nPotent Spellcasting. When you cast a Druid cantrip with a range of 10 feet or greater, the spell\u2019s range increases by 300 feet.\nPrimal Strike. The extra damage of your Primal Strike increases to 2d8.\nLevel 18: Beast Spells \nWhile using Wild Shape, you can cast spells in Beast form, except for any spell that has a Material component with a cost specified or that consumes its Material component.\nLevel 19: Epic Boon \nYou gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Dimensional Travel is recommended.\nLevel 20: Archdruid \nThe vitality of nature constantly blooms within you, granting you the following benefits.\nEvergreen Wild Shape. Whenever you roll Initiative and have no uses of Wild Shape left, you regain one expended use of it.\nNature Magician. You can convert uses of Wild Shape into a spell slot (no action required). Choose a number of your unexpended uses of Wild Shape and convert them into a single spell slot, with each use contributing 2 spell levels. For example, if you convert two uses of Wild Shape, you produce a level 4 spell slot. Once you use this benefit, you can\u2019t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\nLongevity. The primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every ten years that pass, your body ages only one year.\n"

This combination of broad ability and extensive specialization makes Fighters superior combatants.\n\n\nCore Fighter Traits\n\n\nPrimary Ability\nStrength or Dexterity\n\n\nHit Point Die\nD10 per Fighter level\n\n\nSaving Throw Proficiencies\nStrength and Constitution\n\n\nSkill Proficiencies\nChoose 2: Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, History, Insight, Intimidation, Persuasion, Perception, or Survival\n\n\nWeapon Proficiencies\nSimple and Martial weapons\n\n\nArmor Training\nLight, Medium and Heavy armor and Shields\n\n\nStarting Equipment\nChoose A, B, or C: (A) Chain Mail, Greatsword, Flail, 8 Javelins, Dungeoneer\u0027s Pack, and 4gp (B) Studded Leather Armor, Scimitar, Shortsword, Longbow, 20 Arrows, Quiver, Dungeoneer\u0027s Pack and 11 GP; or (C) 155 GP\n\n\nBecoming a Fighter\u0026#8230;\nAs a Level 1 Fighter\n\nGain all the traits in the Core Fighter Traits table.\nGain the Fighter\u2019s level 1 features, which are listed in the Fighter Features table.\n\nAs a Multiclass Fighter\n\nGain the following traits from the Core Fighter Traits table: Hit Point Die, proficiency with Martial weapons, and training with Light and Medium armor and Shields.\nGain the Fighter\u2019s level 1 features, which are listed in the Fighter Features table.\n\nFighter Class Features\nFighter Features\n\n\nLevel\nProficiency Bonus\nClass Features\nSecond Wind\nWeapon Mastery\n\n\n1\n\u002B2\nFighting Style, Second Wind, Weapon Mastery\n2\n3\n\n\n2\n\u002B2\nAction Surge (One Use), Tactical Mind\n2\n3\n\n\n3\n\u002B2\nFighter Subclass\n2\n3\n\n\n4\n\u002B2\nAbility Score Improvement\n3\n4\n\n\n5\n\u002B3\nExtra Attack, Tactical Shift\n3\n4\n\n\n6\n\u002B3\nAbility Score Improvement\n3\n4\n\n\n7\n\u002B3\nSubclass Feature\n3\n4\n\n\n8\n\u002B3\nAbility Score Improvement\n3\n4\n\n\n9\n\u002B4\nIndomitable (One Use), Tactical Master\n3\n4\n\n\n10\n\u002B4\nSubclass Feature\n4\n5\n\n\n11\n\u002B4\nTwo Extra Attacks\n4\n5\n\n\n12\n\u002B4\nAbility Score Improvement\n4\n5\n\n\n13\n\u002B5\nIndomitable (Two Uses), Studied Attacks\n4\n5\n\n\n14\n\u002B5\nAbility Score Improvement\n4\n5\n\n\n15\n\u002B5\nSubclass Feature\n4\n5\n\n\n16\n\u002B5\nAbility Score Improvement\n4\n6\n\n\n17\n\u002B6\nAction Surge (Two Uses), Indomitable (Three Uses)\n4\n6\n\n\n18\n\u002B6\nSubclass Feature\n4\n6\n\n\n19\n\u002B6\nEpic Boon\n4\n6\n\n\n20\n\u002B6\nThree Extra Attacks\n4\n6\n\n\nAs a Fighter, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Fighter levels. These features are listed on the Fighter Features table.\nLevel 1: Fighting Style \nYou gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see chapter 5). Defense is recommended.\nWhenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace the feat you chose with a different Fighting Style feat.\nLevel 1: Second Wind \nYou have a limited well of physical and mental stamina that you can draw on. As a Bonus Action, you can use it to regain Hit Points equal to 1d10 plus your Fighter level.\nYou can use this feature twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\nWhen you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain more uses of this feature, as shown in the Second Wind column of the Fighter Features table.\nLevel 1: Weapon Mastery \nYour training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of three kinds of Simple or Martial weapons of your choice. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.\nWhen you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Fighter Features table.\nLevel 2: Action Surge \nYou can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action, except the Magic action.\nOnce you use this feature, you can\u2019t do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. Starting at level 17, you can use it twice before a rest but only once on a turn.\nLevel 2: Tactical Mind \nYou have a mind for tactics on and off the battlefield. When you fail an ability check, you can expend a use of your Second Wind to push yourself toward success. Rather than regaining Hit Points, you roll 1d10 and add the number rolled to the ability check, potentially turning it into a success. If the check still fails, this use of Second Wind isn\u2019t expended.\nLevel 3: Fighter Subclass \nYou gain a Fighter subclass of your choice. The Battle Master, Champion, Eldritch Knight, and Psi Warrior subclasses are detailed after this class\u2019s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Fighter levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass\u2019s features that are of your Fighter level or lower.\nFighter Subclasses\n    \n\n\n\nName\n\n\nBanneret\n\n\nBattle Master\n\n\nChampion\n\n\nEldritch Knight\n\n\nPsi Warrior\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \nLevel 4: Ability Score Improvement \nYou gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Fighter levels 6, 8, 12, 14, and 16.\nLevel 5: Extra Attack \nYou can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nLevel 5: Tactical Shift \nWhenever you activate your Second Wind with a Bonus Action, you can move up to half your Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.\nLevel 9: Indomitable \nIf you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a bonus equal to your Fighter level. You must use the new roll, and you can\u2019t use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest.\nYou can use this feature twice before a Long Rest starting at level 13 and three times before a Long Rest starting at level 17.\nLevel 9: Tactical Master \nWhen you attack with a weapon whose mastery property you can use, you can replace that property with the Push, Sap, or Slow property for that attack.\nLevel 11: Two Extra Attacks \nYou can attack three times instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nLevel 13: Studied Attacks \nYou study your opponents and learn from each attack you make. If you make an attack roll against a creature and miss, you have Advantage on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.\nLevel 19: Epic Boon \nYou gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Combat Prowess is recommended.\nLevel 20: Three Extra Attacks \nYou can attack four times instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\n"

You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls of your Unarmed Strikes and Monk weapons. In addition, when you use the Grapple or Shove option of your Unarmed Strike, you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to determine the save DC.\nLevel 1: Unarmored Defense \nWhile you aren\u2019t wearing armor or wielding a Shield, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers.\nLevel 2: Monk\u2019s Focus \nYour focus and martial training allow you to harness a well of extraordinary energy within yourself. This energy is represented by Focus Points. Your Monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the Monk Features table.\nYou can expend these points to enhance or fuel certain Monk features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind, each of which is detailed below.\nWhen you expend a Focus Point, it is unavailable until you finish a Short or Long Rest, at the end of which you regain all your expended points.\nSome features that use Focus Points require your target to make a saving throw.

The reduction equals 1d10 plus your Dexterity modifier and Monk level.\nIf you reduce the damage to 0, you can expend 1 Focus Point to redirect some of the attack\u2019s force. If you do so, choose a creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself if the attack was a melee attack or a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself that isn\u2019t behind Total Cover if the attack was a ranged attack. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die plus your Dexterity modifier. The damage is the same type dealt by the attack.\nLevel 3: Monk Subclass \nYou gain a Monk subclass of your choice. The Warrior of Mercy, Warrior of Shadow, Warrior of the Elements, and Warrior of the Open Hand subclasses are detailed after this class\u2019s description.

You gain this feature again at Monk levels 8, 12, and 16.\nLevel 4: Slow Fall \nYou can take a Reaction when you fall to reduce any damage you take from the fall by an amount equal to five times your Monk level.\nLevel 5: Extra Attack \nYou can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nLevel 5: Stunning Strike \nOnce per turn when you hit a creature with a Monk weapon or an Unarmed Strike, you can expend 1 Focus Point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Stunned condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the target\u2019s Speed is halved until the start of your next turn, and the next attack roll made against the target before then has Advantage.\nLevel 6: Empowered Strikes \nWhenever you deal damage with your Unarmed Strike, it can deal your choice of Force damage or its normal damage type.\nLevel 7: Evasion \nWhen you\u2019re subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail.\nYou don\u2019t benefit from this feature if you have the Incapacitated condition.\nLevel 9: Acrobatic Movement \nWhile you aren\u2019t wearing armor or wielding a Shield, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the movement.\nLevel 10: Heightened Focus \nYour Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind gain the following benefits.\nFlurry of Blows. You can expend 1 Focus Point to use Flurry of Blows and make three Unarmed Strikes with it instead of two.\nPatient Defense. When you expend a Focus Point to use Patient Defense, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die.\nStep of the Wind. When you expend a Focus Point to use Step of the Wind, you can choose a willing creature within 5 feet of yourself that is Large or smaller. You move the creature with you until the end of your turn. The creature\u2019s movement doesn\u2019t provoke Opportunity Attacks.\nLevel 10: Self-Restoration \nThrough sheer force of will, you can remove one of the following conditions from yourself at the end of each of your turns: Charmed, Frightened, or Poisoned.\nIn addition, forgoing food and drink doesn\u2019t give you levels of Exhaustion.\nLevel 13: Deflect Energy \nYou can now use your Deflect Attacks feature against attacks that deal any damage type, not just Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing.\nLevel 14: Disciplined Survivor \nYour physical and mental discipline grant you proficiency in all saving throws.\nAdditionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can expend 1 Focus Point to reroll it, and you must use the new roll.\nLevel 15: Perfect Focus \nWhen you roll Initiative and don\u2019t use Uncanny Metabolism, you regain expended Focus Points until you have 4 if you have 3 or fewer.\nLevel 18: Superior Defense \nAt the start of your turn, you can expend 3 Focus Points to bolster yourself against harm for 1 minute or until you have the Incapacitated condition. During that time, you have Resistance to all damage except Force damage.\nLevel 19: Epic Boon \nYou gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Irresistible Offense is recommended.\nLevel 20: Body and Mind \nYou have developed your body and mind to new heights. Your Dexterity and Wisdom scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.\n"

These features are listed in the Paladin Features table.\nLevel 1: Lay On Hands \nYour blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you finish a Long Rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to five times your Paladin level.\nAs a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.\nYou can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing power to remove the Poisoned condition from the creature; those points don\u0027t also restore Hit Points to the creature.\nLevel 1: Spellcasting \nYou have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See Chapter 7 for the rules on Spellcasting. The Information below details how you use those rules with Paladin spells, which appear in the Paladin spell list later in the class\u0027s description.\nSpell Slots. The Paladin Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1\u002B spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1\u002B. You prepare the list of level 1\u002B spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin spells Heroism and Searing Smite are recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Paladin Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Paladin spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you\u0027re a level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\nIf another Paladin feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don\u2019t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Paladin spell for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells.\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells.\nLevel 1: Weapon Mastery \nYour training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longswords and Javelins.\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For Example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Halberds and Flails.\nLevel 2: Fighting Style \nYou gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see chapter 5). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below.\nBlessed Warrior. You learn two Cleric cantrips of your choice (See the Cleric class\u0027s section for a list of Cleric spells). Guidance and Sacred Flame are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Paladin level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Cleric cantrip.\nLevel 2: Paladin\u0027s Smite \nYou always have the Divine Smite spell prepared.\nYou can cast it without expending a spell slot, but you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it this way again.\nLevel 3: Channel Divinity \nYou can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using it to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time you use this class\u0027s Channel Divinity, you choose which effect from this class to create.\nYou can use this class\u0027s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain an additional use when you reach Paladin level 11.\nIf a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class\u0027s Spellcasting Feature.\nDivine Sense. As a Bonus Action, you can open your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have the Incapacitated condition, you know the location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the Hallow spell.\nLevel 3: Paladin Subclass \nYou gain a Paladin Subclass of your choice. The Oath of Devotion, Oath of Glory, Oath of the Ancients and Oath of Vengeance subclasses are detailed after this class\u0027s description. A Subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Paladin levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass\u2019s features that are of your Paladin level or lower.\nPaladin Subclasses\n    \n\n\n\nName\n\n\nOath of Devotion\n\n\nOath of Glory\n\n\nOath of the Ancients\n\n\nOath of the Noble Genies\n\n\nOath of Vengeance\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \nBreaking Your Oath\nA Paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most dedicated are fallible. Sometimes a Paladin transgresses on their oath.\nA Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution, spending an all-night vigil as a sign of penitence or undertaking a fast. After a rite of forgiveness, the Paladin starts fresh.\nIf your Paladin unrepentantly violates their oath, talk to your DM. Your Paladin should probably take a more appropriate subclass or even abandon the class and adopt another one.\nLevel 4: Ability Score Improvement \nYou gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Paladin levels 8, 12, and 16.\nLevel 5: Extra Attack \nYou can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nLevel 5: Faithful Steed \nYou can call on the aid of an otherworldly steed.\nYou always have the Find Steed spell prepared.\nYou can also cast the spell once without expending a spell slot, and you regain your ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 6: Aura of Protection \nYou radiate a protective, unseeable aura in a 10-foot Emanation that originates from you. The aura is inactive while you have the Incapacitated condition.\nYou and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum bonus of \u002B1).\nIf another Paladin is present, a creature can benefit from only one Aura of Protection at a time; the creature chooses which aura while in them.\nLevel 9: Abjure Foes \nAs a Magic action, you can expend one use of this class\u0027s Channel Divinity to overwhelm foes with awe. As you present your Holy Symbol or weapon, you can target a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) that you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While Frightened in this way, a target can only do one of the following on its turns: move, take an action or take a Bonus Action.\nLevel 10: Aura of Courage \nYou and your allies have Immunity to the Frightened condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a Frightened ally enters the aura, that condition has no effect on that ally while there.\nLevel 11: Radiant Strikes \nYour strikes now carry supernatural power. When you hit a target with an attack roll using a Melee weapon or an Unarmed Strike, the target takes an extra 1d8 Radiant damage.\nLevel 14: Restoring Touch \nWhen you use Lay On Hands on a creature, you can also remove one or more of the following conditions from the creature: Blinded, Charmed, Deafened, Frightened, Paralyzed, or Stunned. You must expend 5 Hit Points from the healing pool of Lay On Hands for each of these conditions you remove; those points don\u0027t also restore Hit Points to the creature.\nLevel 18: Aura Expansion \nYour Aura of Protection is now a 30-foot Emanation.\nLevel 19: Epic Boon \nYou gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Truesight is recommended.\n"

Whatever a Rogue\u0027s relation to the law, no common criminal or officer of the law can match the subtle brilliance of the greatest Rogues.\n\n\nCore Rogue Traits\n\n\nPrimary Ability\nDexterity\n\n\nHit Point Die\nD8 per Rogue level\n\n\nSaving Throw Proficiencies\nDexterity and Intelligence\n\n\nSkill Proficiencies\nChoose 4: Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth.\n\n\nWeapon Proficiencies\nSimple weapons and Martial weapons that have the Finesse or Light property\n\n\nTool Proficiencies\nThieves\u0027 Tools\n\n\nArmor Training\nLight armor\n\n\nStarting Equipment\nChoose A or B: (A) Leather Armor, 2 Daggers, Shortsword, Shortbow, 20 Arrows, Quiver, Thieves\u0027 Tools, Burglar\u0027s Pack and 8 GP; or (B) 100 GP\n\n\nBecoming a Rogue \u0026#8230;\nAs a Level 1 Character\n\nGain all the traits in the Core Rogue Traits table.\nGain the Rogue\u0027s level 1 features, which are listed in the Rogue Features table.\n\nAs a Multiclass Character\n\nGain the following traits from the Core Rogue Traits table: Hit Point Die, proficiency in one skill of your choice from the Rogue\u0027s skill list, proficiency with Thieves\u0027 Tools, and training with Light Armor.\nGain the Rogue\u0027s level 1 features, which are listed in the Rogue Features table.\n\nRogue Class Features\nRogue Features\n\n\nLevel\nProficiency Bonus\nClass Features\nSneak Attack\n\n\n1\n\u002B2\nExpertise, Sneak Attack, Thieves\u0027 Cant, Weapon Mastery\n1d6\n\n\n2\n\u002B2\nCunning Action\n1d6\n\n\n3\n\u002B2\nRogue Subclass, Steady Aim\n2d6\n\n\n4\n\u002B2\nAbility Score Improvement\n2d6\n\n\n5\n\u002B3\nCunning Strike, Uncanny Dodge\n3d6\n\n\n6\n\u002B3\nExpertise\n3d6\n\n\n7\n\u002B3\nEvasion, Reliable Talent\n4d6\n\n\n8\n\u002B3\nAbility Score Improvement\n4d6\n\n\n9\n\u002B4\nSubclass Feature\n5d6\n\n\n10\n\u002B4\nAbility Score Improvement\n5d6\n\n\n11\n\u002B4\nImproved Cunning Strike\n6d6\n\n\n12\n\u002B4\nAbility Score Improvement\n6d6\n\n\n13\n\u002B5\nSubclass Feature\n7d6\n\n\n14\n\u002B5\nDevious Strikes\n7d6\n\n\n15\n\u002B5\nSlippery Mind\n8d6\n\n\n16\n\u002B5\nAbility Score Improvement\n8d6\n\n\n17\n\u002B6\nSubclass Feature\n9d6\n\n\n18\n\u002B6\nElusive\n9d6\n\n\n19\n\u002B6\nEpic Boon\n10d6\n\n\n20\n\u002B6\nStroke of Luck\n10d6\n\n\nAs a Rogue, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Rogue levels. These features are listed in the Rogue Features table.\nLevel 1: Expertise \nYou gain Expertise in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice. Sleight of Hand and Stealth are recommended if you have proficiency in them.\nAt Rogue Level 6, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your Choice.\nLevel 1: Sneak Attack \nYou know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe\u0027s distraction. Once per turn you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack roll if you have Advantage on the roll and the attack uses a Finesse or a Ranged weapon. The extra damage\u0027s type is the same was the weapon\u0027s type.\nYou don\u0027t need Advantage on the attack roll if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target, the ally doesn\u0027t have the Incapacitated condition and you don\u0027t have Disadvantage on the attack roll.\nThe extra damage increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue Features table.\nLevel 1: Thieves\u0027 Cant \nYou picked up various languages in the communities where you plied your roguish talents. You know Thieves\u0027 Cant and one other language of your choice, which you choose from the language tables in Chapter 2.\nLevel 1: Weapon Mastery \nYour training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Daggers and Shortbows.\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Scimitars and Shortswords.\nLevel 2: Cunning Action \nYour quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. On your turn, you can take one of the following actions as a Bonus Action: Dash, Disengage, or Hide.\nLevel 3: Rogue Subclass \nYou gain a Rogue subclass of your choice. The Arcane Trickster, Assassin, Soulknife, and the Thief subclasses are detailed after this class\u0027s description. A Subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Rogue levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass\u2019s features that are of your Rogue level or lower.\nRogue Subclasses\n    \n\n\n\nName\n\n\nArcane Trickster\n\n\nAssassin\n\n\nScion of the Three\n\n\nSoulknife\n\n\nThief\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \nLevel 3: Steady Aim \nAs a Bonus Action, you give yourself Advantage on your next attack roll on your current turn. You can use this feature only if you haven\u0027t moved during this turn, and after you use it, your Speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.\nLevel 4: Ability Score Improvement \nYou gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Rogue levels 8, 10, 12, and 16.\nLevel 5: Cunning Strike \nYou\u0027ve developed cunning ways to use your Sneak Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects. Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of Sneak Attack dice you must forgo to add the effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the effect occurs immediately after the attack\u0027s damage is dealt. For example, if you add the Poison effect, remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack\u0027s damage before rolling.\nIf a Cunning Strike requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus.\nPoison (Cost: 1d6). You add a toxin to your strike, forcing the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Poisoned condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the poisoned target repeats the save, ending the effect on a success.\nTo use this effect, you must have a Poisoner\u0027s Kit on your person.\nTrip (Cost: 1d6). If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition.\nWithdraw (Cost: 1d6). Immediately after the attack, you move up to half your speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.\nLevel 5: Uncanny Dodge \nWhen an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to halve the attack\u0027s damage against you (round down).\nLevel 7: Evasion \nYou can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain dangers. When you\u0027re subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail. You can\u0027t use this feature if you have the Incapacitated condition.\nLevel 7: Reliable Talent \nWhenever you make an ability check that uses one of your skill or tool proficiencies, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.\nLevel 11: Improved Cunning Strike \nYou can use up to two Cunning Strike effects when you deal Sneak Attack damage, paying the die cost for each effect.\nLevel 14: Devious Strikes \nYou\u0027ve practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack deviously. The following effects are now among your Cunning Strike options.\nDaze (Cost: 2d6). The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or on its next turn, it can do only one of the following: move or take an action or a Bonus Action.\nKnock Out (Cost: 6d6). The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it has the Unconscious condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. The Unconscious target repeats the save at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\nObscure (Cost: 3d6). The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, or it has the Blinded condition until the end of its next turn.\nLevel 15: Slippery Mind \nYour mind is exceptionally difficult to control. You gain proficiency in Wisdom and Charisma saving throws.\nLevel 18: Elusive \nYou\u0027re so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll can have advantage against you unless you have the Incapacitated condition.\nLevel 19: Epic Boon \nYou gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of the Night Spirit is recommended.\nLevel 20: Stroke of Luck \nYou have a marvelous knack for succeeding when you need to. If you fail a d20 Test, you can turn the roll into a 20.\nOnce you use this feature, you can\u0027t use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.\n"

These features are listed in the Sorcerer Features table.\nLevel 1: Spellcasting \nDrawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Sorcerer spells, which appear in the Sorcerer spell list later in the class\u2019s description.\nCantrips. You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice. Light, Prestidigitation, Shocking Grasp, and Sorcerous Burst are recommended. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice.\nWhen you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sorcerer Features table.\nSpell Slots. The Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1\u002B spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1\u002B. You prepare the list of level 1\u002B spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells. Burning Hands and Detect Magic are recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you\u2019re a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.\nIf another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don\u2019t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells.\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.\nLevel 1: Innate Sorcery \nAn event in your past left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with simmering magic. As a Bonus Action, you can unleash that magic for 1 minute, during which you gain the following benefits:\n\nThe spell save DC of your Sorcerer spells increases by 1.\nYou have Advantage on the attack rolls of Sorcerer spells you cast.\n\nYou can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 2: Font of Magic \nYou can tap into the wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by Sorcery Points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.\nYou have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer Features table. You can\u2019t have more Sorcery Points than the number shown in the table for your level. You regain all expended Sorcery Points when you finish a Long Rest.\nYou can use your Sorcery Points to fuel the options below, along with other features, such as Metamagic, that use those points.\nConverting Spell Slots to Sorcery Points. You can expend a spell slot to gain a number of Sorcery Points equal to the slot\u2019s level (no action required).\nCreating Spell Slots. As a Bonus Action, you can transform unexpended Sorcery Points into one spell slot. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level, and it lists the minimum Sorcerer level you must be to create a slot. You can create a spell slot no higher than level 5.\nAny spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a Long Rest.\nCreating Spell Slots\n\n\nSpell Slot Level\nSorcery Point Cost\nMin. Sorcerer Level\n\n\n1\n2\n2\n\n\n2\n3\n3\n\n\n3\n5\n5\n\n\n4\n6\n7\n\n\n5\n7\n9\n\n\nLevel 2: Metamagic \nBecause your magic flows from within, you can alter your spells to suit your needs; you gain two Metamagic options of your choice from \u201CMetamagic Options\u201D later in this class\u2019s description. You use the chosen options to temporarily modify spells you cast. To use an option, you must spend the number of Sorcery Points that it costs.\nYou can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of those options.\nWhenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with one you don\u2019t know. You gain two more options at Sorcerer level 10 and two more at Sorcerer level 17.\nLevel 3: Sorcerer Subclass \nYou gain a Sorcerer subclass of your choice. The Aberrant Sorcery, Clockwork Sorcery, Draconic Sorcery, and Wild Magic Sorcery subclasses are detailed after this class\u2019s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass\u2019s features that are of your Sorcerer level or lower.\nSorcerer Subclasses\n    \n\n\n\nName\n\n\nAberrant Sorcery\n\n\nClockwork Sorcery\n\n\nDraconic Sorcery\n\n\nSpellfire Sorcery\n\n\nWild Magic Sorcery\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \nLevel 4: Ability Score Improvement \nYou gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Sorcerer levels 8, 12, and 16.\nLevel 5: Sorcerous Restoration \nWhen you finish a Short Rest, you can regain expended Sorcery Points, but no more than a number equal to half your Sorcerer level (round down). Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 7: Sorcery Incarnate \nIf you have no uses of Innate Sorcery left, you can use it if you spend 2 Sorcery Points when you take the Bonus Action to activate it.\nIn addition, while your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use up to two of your Metamagic options on each spell you cast.\nLevel 19: Epic Boon \nYou gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Dimensional Travel is recommended.\nLevel 20: Arcane Apotheosis \nWhile your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use one Metamagic option on each of your turns without spending Sorcery Points on it.\n"

These features are listed in the Warlock Features table.\nLevel 1: Eldritch Invocations \nYou have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, pieces of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability or other lessons. You gain one invocation of your choice, such as Pact of the Tome. Invocations are described in the \u201CEldritch Invocation Options\u201D section later in this class\u2019s description.\nPrerequisites. If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For example, if an invocation requires you to be a level 5\u002B Warlock, you can select the invocation once you reach Warlock level 5.\nReplacing and Gaining Invocations. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify. You can\u2019t replace an invocation if it\u2019s a prerequisite for another invocation that you have.\nWhen you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the Warlock Features table.\nYou can\u2019t pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says otherwise.\nLevel 1: Pact Magic \nThrough occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows\u2014its identity unclear\u2014but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the Warlock spell list later in the class\u2019s description.\nCantrips. You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. Eldritch Blast and Prestidigitation are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.\nWhen you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table.\nSpell Slots. The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1\u20135. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.\nFor example, when you\u2019re a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell Witch Bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1\u002B. You prepare the list of level 1\u002B spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells. Charm Person and Hex are recommended.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what\u2019s shown in the table\u2019s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1\u20133.\nIf another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don\u2019t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level.\nSpellcasting Ability. Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.\nLevel 2: Magical Cunning \nYou can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute. At the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell slots but no more than a number equal to half your maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 3: Warlock Subclass \nYou gain a Warlock subclass of your choice. The Archfey Patron, Celestial Patron, Fiend Patron, and Great Old One Patron subclasses are detailed after this class\u2019s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass\u2019s features that are of your Warlock level or lower.\nWarlock Subclasses\n    \n\n\n\nName\n\n\nArchfey Patron\n\n\nCelestial Patron\n\n\nFiend Patron\n\n\nGreat Old One Patron\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \nLevel 4: Ability Score Improvement \nYou gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Warlock levels 8, 12, and 16.\nLevel 9: Contact Patron \nIn the past, you usually contacted your patron through intermediaries. Now you can communicate directly; you always have the Contact Other Plane spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell\u2019s saving throw.\nOnce you cast the spell with this feature, you can\u2019t do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 11: Mystic Arcanum \nYour patron grants you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one level 6 Warlock spell as this arcanum.\nYou can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again.\nAs shown in the Warlock Features table, you gain another Warlock spell of your choice that can be cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels 13 (level 7 spell), 15 (level 8 spell), and 17 (level 9 spell). You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a Long Rest.\nWhenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your arcanum spells with another Warlock spell of the same level.\nLevel 19: Epic Boon \nYou gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended.\nLevel 20: Eldritch Master \nWhen you use your Magical Cunning feature, you regain all your expended Pact Magic spell slots.\n"

These features are listed in the Wizard Features table.\nLevel 1: Spellcasting \nAs a student of arcane magic, you have learned to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Wizard spells, which appear in the Wizard spell list later in the class\u2019s description.\nCantrips. You know three Wizard cantrips of your choice. Light, Mage Hand, and Ray of Frost are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.\nWhen you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Wizard Features table.\nSpellbook. Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting Identify. You determine the book\u2019s appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine.\nThe book contains the level 1\u002B spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice. Detect Magic, Feather Fall, Mage Armor, Magic Missile, Sleep, and Thunderwave are recommended.\nWhenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Wizard Features table. The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly.\nSpell Slots. The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1\u002B spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\nPrepared Spells of Level 1\u002B. You prepare the list of level 1\u002B spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you\u0027re a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.\nIf another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don\u2019t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you.\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook.\nSpellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.\nExpanding and Replacing a Spellbook\nThe spells you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect your ongoing magical research, but you might find other spells during your adventures that you can add to the book. You could discover a Wizard spell on a Spell Scroll, for example, and then copy it into your spellbook.\nCopying a Spell into the Book.\nWhen you find a level 1\u002B Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it\u2019s of a level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your spellbook.\nCopying the Book.\nYou can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied spell.\nIf you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of the new book requires you to find new spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a backup spellbook.\nLevel 1: Ritual Adept \nYou can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You needn\u2019t have the spell prepared, but you must read from the book to cast a spell in this way.\nLevel 1: Arcane Recovery \nYou can regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. When you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher. For example, if you\u0027re a level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two levels\u2019 worth of spell slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell slots.\nOnce you use this feature, you can\u0027t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.\nLevel 2: Scholar \nWhile studying magic, you also specialized in another field of study. Choose one of the following skills in which you have proficiency: Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or Religion. You have Expertise in the chosen skill.\nLevel 3: Arcane Tradition \nYou gain a Wizard subclass of your choice. The Abjurer, Diviner, Evoker, and Illusionist subclasses are detailed after this class\u2019s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Wizard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass\u2019s features that are of your Wizard level or lower.\nWizard Subclasses\n    \n\n\n\nName\n\n\nAbjurer\n\n\nBladesinger\n\n\nDiviner\n\n\nEvoker\n\n\nIllusionist\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \nLevel 4: Ability Score Improvement \nYou gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Wizard levels 8, 12, and 16.\nLevel 5: Memorize Spell \nWhenever you finish a Short Rest, you can study your spellbook and replace one of the level 1\u002B Wizard spells you have prepared for your Spellcasting feature with another level 1\u002B spell from the book.\nLevel 18: Spell Mastery \nYou have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a level 1 and a level 2 spell in your spellbook that have a casting time of an action. You always have those spells prepared, and you can cast them at their lowest level without expending a spell slot. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can study your spellbook and replace one of those spells with an eligible spell of the same level from the book.\nLevel 19: Epic Boon \nYou gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Spell Recall is recommended.\nLevel 20: Signature Spells \nChoose two level 3 spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, and you can cast each of them once at level 3 without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can\u0027t cast them in this way again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.\n"
