If you take a Magic action to throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself, the figurine becomes a living creature specified in the figurine\u2019s description below. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn\u2019t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn\u2019t become a creature.\n\nThe creature is Friendly to you and your allies. It understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.\n\nThe creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if its creature form drops to 0 Hit Points or if you take a Magic action while touching the creature to make it revert to figurine form. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can\u2019t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine\u2019s description.\n\nThis bronze statuette is of a griffon rampant. It can become a Griffon for up to 6 hours.

The goat can\u2019t attack, but you can (harmlessly) remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a \u002B1 Lance, and the other becomes a \u002B2 Longsword. Removing a horn requires a Magic action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. While you ride the goat, any Hostile creature that starts its turn within a 30-foot Emanation originating from the goat must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute, until you are no longer riding the goat, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The Frightened creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it succeeds on the save, a creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 15 days have passed.\n\nGoat of Traveling. This figurine can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a Riding Horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in goat form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can\u2019t be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all expended charges.\n\nGoat of Travail. This figurine can become a Giant Goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 30 days have passed.\n\nThis marble statuette resembles a trumpeting elephant. It can become an Elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 7 days have passed.\n\nThis polished obsidian horse can become a Nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 5 days have passed.\n\nThe figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.\n\nThis onyx statuette of a dog can become a Mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has Blindsight with a range of 60 feet. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 7 days have passed.\n\nThis serpentine statuette of an owl can become a Giant Owl for up to 8 hours. The owl can communicate telepathically with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 2 days have passed.\n\nThis silver statuette of a raven can become a Raven for up to 12 hours.

A creature riding in the gyrocopter wonder can take a Utilize action to attach itself to or detach itself from one of these cords. A creature attached to a cord can leap from the gyrocopter wonder and glide, moving up to 5 feet horizontally for every 1 foot it descends in the air.

While inactive, the mobility wonder resembles a metal turtle shell with straps. It is designed to be worn on your back or flank, depending on your anatomy. Once wound, the mobility wonder transforms into a personal transport device and remains active for 24 hours. While active, the mobility wonder increases your Speed to 30 feet.

    "Description": "Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies\n\nThis object looks like a feather. Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use effect. The DM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly by rolling on the Quaal\u2019s Feather Tokens table. The type of token determines its rarity.\n\nAnchor (Uncommon)\nYou can take a Magic action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can\u2019t be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.\n\nBird (Rare)\nYou can take a Magic action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a Roc, but it can\u2019t attack. It obeys your simple commands and can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles per hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a 1-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying) or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 Hit Points. You can dismiss the bird as a Magic action.\n\nFan (Uncommon)\nIf you are on a boat or ship, you can take a Magic action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a strong wind. This wind can fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as a Magic action.\n\nSwan Boat (Rare)\nYou can take a Magic action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot-wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can take a Magic action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as a Magic action.\n\nTree (Uncommon)\nYou must be outdoors to use this token. You can take a Magic action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.\n\nWhip (Rare)\nYou can take a Magic action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of yourself. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then take a Bonus Action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of \u002B9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 \u002B 5 Force damage.\n\nAs a Bonus Action, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you take a Magic action to dismiss it, or when you die or have the Incapacitated condition.",

    "Category": "Rare",
    "Source": "Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide",
    "Description": "Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies\n\nA Figurine of Wondrous Power is a statuette small enough to fit in a pocket. If you take a Magic action to throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself, the figurine becomes a living creature specified in the figurine\u2019s description below. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn\u2019t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn\u2019t become a creature.\n\nThe creature is Friendly to you and your allies. It understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.\n\nThe creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if its creature form drops to 0 Hit Points or if you take a Magic action while touching the creature to make it revert to figurine form. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can\u2019t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine\u2019s description.\n\nThis bronze statuette is of a griffon rampant. It can become a Griffon for up to 6 hours. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 5 days have passed.\n\nThis ebony statuette, carved in the likeness of a horsefly, can become a Giant Fly (see the accompanying stat block) for up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 2 days have passed.\n\nThese gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a Lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 7 days have passed.\n\nThese ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:\n\nGoat of Terror. This figurine can become a Giant Goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can\u2019t attack, but you can (harmlessly) remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a \u002B1 Lance, and the other becomes a \u002B2 Longsword. Removing a horn requires a Magic action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. While you ride the goat, any Hostile creature that starts its turn within a 30-foot Emanation originating from the goat must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute, until you are no longer riding the goat, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The Frightened creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it succeeds on the save, a creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 15 days have passed.\n\nGoat of Traveling. This figurine can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a Riding Horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in goat form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can\u2019t be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all expended charges.\n\nGoat of Travail. This figurine can become a Giant Goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 30 days have passed.\n\nThis marble statuette resembles a trumpeting elephant. It can become an Elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 7 days have passed.\n\nThis polished obsidian horse can become a Nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 5 days have passed.\n\nThe figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.\n\nThis onyx statuette of a dog can become a Mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has Blindsight with a range of 60 feet. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 7 days have passed.\n\nThis serpentine statuette of an owl can become a Giant Owl for up to 8 hours. The owl can communicate telepathically with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 2 days have passed.\n\nThis silver statuette of a raven can become a Raven for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine grants you the ability to cast Animal Messenger on it.",

The DM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly by rolling on the Quaal\u2019s Feather Tokens table. The type of token determines its rarity.\n\nAnchor (Uncommon)\nYou can take a Magic action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can\u2019t be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.\n\nBird (Rare)\nYou can take a Magic action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a Roc, but it can\u2019t attack. It obeys your simple commands and can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles per hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a 1-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying) or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 Hit Points. You can dismiss the bird as a Magic action.\n\nFan (Uncommon)\nIf you are on a boat or ship, you can take a Magic action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a strong wind. This wind can fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as a Magic action.\n\nSwan Boat (Rare)\nYou can take a Magic action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot-wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can take a Magic action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as a Magic action.\n\nTree (Uncommon)\nYou must be outdoors to use this token. You can take a Magic action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.\n\nWhip (Rare)\nYou can take a Magic action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of yourself. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then take a Bonus Action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of \u002B9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 \u002B 5 Force damage.\n\nAs a Bonus Action, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you take a Magic action to dismiss it, or when you die or have the Incapacitated condition.",

    "Description": "Weapon (Longbow or Shortbow), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)\n\nYou gain a \u002B1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has no string. Each time you pull your arm back in a firing motion, a magical arrow made of golden energy appears nocked and ready to fire. An arrow produced by this weapon deals Force damage instead of Piercing damage on a hit, and it disappears after it hits or misses its target. Until it disappears, the arrow emits Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet.\n\nThis weapon has the following additional properties.\n\nArrow of Restraint. Whenever you use this weapon to make a ranged attack against a creature, you can try to restrain the target instead of dealing damage to it. If the arrow hits, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have the Restrained condition for 1 minute. As an action, a creature Restrained by an arrow can make a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check to try to break the restraint, ending the effect on itself on a successful check.\n\nArrow of Transport. As a Magic action, you can fire one energy arrow from this weapon at a target you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The target can be either a willing Medium or smaller creature or an object that isn\u2019t being worn or carried, provided the object is small enough to fit inside a 5-foot Cube. The arrow teleports the target to an unoccupied space you can see within 10 feet of you.\n\nEnergy Ladder. As a Magic action, you can loose a flurry of energy arrows from this weapon at a wall up to 60 feet away from yourself. The arrows become glowing rungs that stick out of the wall, forming a magical ladder up to 60 feet long on the wall. This ladder lasts for 1 minute before disappearing.",

    "Description": "Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies\n\nA Figurine of Wondrous Power is a statuette small enough to fit in a pocket. If you take a Magic action to throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself, the figurine becomes a living creature specified in the figurine\u2019s description below. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn\u2019t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn\u2019t become a creature.\n\nThe creature is Friendly to you and your allies. It understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.\n\nThe creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if its creature form drops to 0 Hit Points or if you take a Magic action while touching the creature to make it revert to figurine form. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can\u2019t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine\u2019s description.\n\nThis bronze statuette is of a griffon rampant. It can become a Griffon for up to 6 hours. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 5 days have passed.\n\nThis ebony statuette, carved in the likeness of a horsefly, can become a Giant Fly (see the accompanying stat block) for up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 2 days have passed.\n\nThese gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a Lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 7 days have passed.\n\nThese ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:\n\nGoat of Terror. This figurine can become a Giant Goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can\u2019t attack, but you can (harmlessly) remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a \u002B1 Lance, and the other becomes a \u002B2 Longsword. Removing a horn requires a Magic action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. While you ride the goat, any Hostile creature that starts its turn within a 30-foot Emanation originating from the goat must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute, until you are no longer riding the goat, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The Frightened creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it succeeds on the save, a creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 15 days have passed.\n\nGoat of Traveling. This figurine can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a Riding Horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in goat form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can\u2019t be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all expended charges.\n\nGoat of Travail. This figurine can become a Giant Goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 30 days have passed.\n\nThis marble statuette resembles a trumpeting elephant. It can become an Elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 7 days have passed.\n\nThis polished obsidian horse can become a Nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 5 days have passed.\n\nThe figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.\n\nThis onyx statuette of a dog can become a Mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has Blindsight with a range of 60 feet. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 7 days have passed.\n\nThis serpentine statuette of an owl can become a Giant Owl for up to 8 hours. The owl can communicate telepathically with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 2 days have passed.\n\nThis silver statuette of a raven can become a Raven for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine grants you the ability to cast Animal Messenger on it.",

    "Category": "Legendary",
    "Source": "Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide",
    "Description": "Wondrous Item, Legendary\n\nUsually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have thirteen cards, but some have twenty-two. Use the appropriate column of the Deck of Many Things table when randomly determining cards drawn from the deck.\n\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.\n\nOnce a card is drawn, it disappears. Unless the card is the Fool or Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice. (Once the Fool or Jester has left the deck, reroll on the table if that card comes up again.)\n\nEach card\u2019s effect is described below.\n\nBalance \nYou can increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 22, provided you also decrease another one of your ability scores by 2. You can\u2019t decrease an ability that has a score of 5 or lower. Alternatively, you can choose not to adjust your ability scores, in which case this card has no effect.\n\nComet \nThe next time you enter combat against one or more Hostile creatures, you can select one of them as your foe when you roll Initiative. If you reduce your foe to 0 Hit Points during that combat, you have Advantage on Death Saving Throws for 1 year. If someone else reduces your chosen foe to 0 Hit Points or you don\u2019t choose a foe, this card has no effect.\n\nDonjon \nYou disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you\u2019re wearing and carrying disappears with you except for Artifacts, which stay behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can\u2019t be located by any Divination magic, but a Wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.\n\nEuryale \nThe card\u2019s medusa-like visage curses you. You take a \u22122 penalty to saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of the Fates card can end this curse.\n\nFates \nReality\u2019s fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card\u2019s magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\n\nFlames \nA powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and torments you, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\n\nFool \nYou have Disadvantage on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours. Draw another card; this draw doesn\u2019t count as one of your declared draws.\n\nGem \nTwenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 GP each or fifty gems worth 1,000 GP each appear at your feet.\n\nJester \nYou have Advantage on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\n\nKey \nA Rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears on your person. The DM chooses the weapon.\n\nKnight \nYou gain the service of a Knight, who magically appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself. The knight has the same alignment as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the two of you have been drawn together by fate. Work with your DM to create a name and backstory for this NPC. The DM can use a different stat block to represent the knight, as desired.\n\nMoon \nYou gain the ability to cast Wish 1d3 times.\n\nPuzzle \nPermanently reduce your Intelligence or Wisdom by 1d4 \u002B 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\n\nRogue \nAn NPC of the DM\u2019s choice becomes Hostile toward you. You don\u2019t know the identity of this NPC until they or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a Wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC\u2019s hostility toward you.\n\nRuin \nAll forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. If you have a Bastion, it is destroyed by some calamity beyond your control. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\n\nSage \nAt any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question.\n\nSkull \nAn Avatar of Death (see the accompanying stat block) appears in an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The avatar targets only you with its attacks, appearing as a ghostly skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or you die. If an ally of yours deals damage to the avatar, that ally summons another Avatar of Death. The new avatar appears in an unoccupied space as close to that ally as possible and targets only that ally with its attacks. You and your allies can each summon only one avatar as a consequence of this draw. A creature slain by an avatar can\u2019t be restored to life.\n\nStar \nIncrease one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 24.\n\nSun \nA magic item (chosen by the DM) appears on your person. In addition, you gain 10 Temporary Hit Points daily at dawn until you die.\n\nTalons \nEvery magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession vanish instead.\n\nThrone \nYou gain proficiency and Expertise in your choice of History, Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently home to one or more monsters, which must be cleared out before you can claim the keep as yours.\n\nVoid \nYour soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM\u2019s choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert, ceases aging, and requires no food, air, or water. A Wish spell can\u2019t return your soul to your body, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds your soul. You draw no more cards.",

The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.\n\nButtons. You can press one of the following buttons as a Bonus Action; a button\u2019s effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form:\n\nButton 1. A fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod\u2019s flanged head. The flames shed Bright Light in a 40-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 40 feet, and the blade functions as a magic Longsword or Shortsword (your choice) that deals an extra 2d6 Fire damage on a hit.\n\nButton 2. The rod\u2019s flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic Battleaxe that grants a \u002B3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.\n\nButton 3. The rod\u2019s flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod\u2019s tip, and the rod\u2019s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic Spear that grants a \u002B3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.\n\nButton 4. The rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long (you specify the length), though the rod\u2019s buttons remain within your reach.

    "Description": "Weapon (Battleaxe), Artifact (Requires Attunement)\n\nA young dwarf prince set out to forge a weapon that would be regarded as a symbol of unity among his people. Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, a god of creation, he first crafted four mighty tools: the Starmetal Pick, the Earthheart Forge, the Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With these tools, he forged the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords.\n\nArmed with the Artifact, the prince brought peace to the dwarf clans, ending grudges and answering slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.\n\nLater, in an era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.\n\nMagic Weapon. The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is a magic weapon that grants a \u002B3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.\n\nWhen you attack a creature with the axe and roll a 20 on the d20 for the attack roll, the axe deals an extra 20 Slashing damage.\n\nThe axe has the Thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

Whenever you use Blackrazor to reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points, the sword slays the creature and devours its soul unless it is a Construct or an Undead. A creature whose soul has been devoured by Blackrazor can be restored to life only by a Wish spell.\n\nWhen Blackrazor devours a soul that isn\u2019t yours, you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to the slain creature\u2019s Hit Point maximum.\n\nHaste. Blackrazor can cast Haste on you, after which it can\u2019t cast this spell again until the next dawn. Blackrazor decides when to cast the spell, which takes effect at the start of your turn.

Blackrazor is a sentient Chaotic Neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet.\n\nThe weapon speaks Common and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is deep and echoing.

Blackrazor speaks with an imperious tone, as though accustomed to being obeyed.\n\nThe sword\u2019s purpose is to consume souls. It doesn\u2019t care whose souls it eats, including the wielder\u2019s. The sword believes that all matter and energy sprang from a void of negative energy and will one day return to it. Blackrazor is meant to hurry that process along.\n\nDespite its nihilism, Blackrazor feels a strange kinship to Wave and Whelm, two other weapons locked away under White Plume Mountain. It wants the three weapons to be reunited and wielded together in combat, even though it violently disagrees with Whelm and finds Wave tedious.\n\nBlackrazor\u2019s hunger for souls must be regularly fed. If the sword goes 3 days or more without consuming a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder occurs at the next sunset.\n\nDestroying Blackrazor. Blackrazor can be destroyed by crushing it in the great gears of Mechanus. Primus, the creator of the modrons, also knows a series of musical tones that Blackrazor can\u2019t stand to hear, causing the sword to shatter.",

Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn, or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that the original text can\u2019t be divined.\n\nNature can\u2019t abide the book\u2019s presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, common animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough.\n\nWhenever a creature that isn\u2019t a Fiend or an Undead attunes to the Book of Vile Darkness, that creature makes a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is magically transformed into a Larva under the DM\u2019s control. Only a Wish spell can reverse this vile transformation.\n\nA creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and use its Adjusted Ability Scores, Tireless Form, Spells, Vile Lore, and Vile Speech properties.\n\nThe Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears, your Attunement to it ends immediately, and you lose all benefits granted by it. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can\u2019t be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned.\n\nAdjusted Ability Scores. One ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can\u2019t adjust your ability scores again.\n\nTireless Form. While the book is on your person, you have Immunity to the Exhaustion condition.\n\nRandom Properties. The Book of Vile Darkness has the following random properties (see \u201CArtifacts\u201D):\n\nSpells. While attuned to the book and holding it, you can cast the following spells (save DC 18) from it:\n\nOnce you use the book to cast a spell, you can\u2019t cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.\n\nVile Lore. You can reference the Book of Vile Darkness whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so, you have Advantage on that check.\n\nAt the DM\u2019s discretion, the book might reveal secrets no mortal should know, such as the true names of powerful Fiends, foul rites that allow one to transform into a death knight or lich, or long-lost spells crafted by beings so evil their names ought never to be spoken aloud.\n\nVile Speech. While the book is on your person, you can take a Magic action to recite words from its pages in a foul, dead language. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 Psychic damage, and each creature within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 Psychic damage unless the creature is a Fiend or an Undead.\n\nDestroying the Book. The Book of Vile Darkness allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome.\n\nIf a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for 1d100 years, after which it re-forms in some far corner of the multiverse.\n\nA creature attuned to the book for 100 years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book re-forms 1d10 \u00D7 100 years later.",

You have a Fly Speed of 30 feet and can hover.\n\nSpells.

    "Description": "Wondrous Item, Artifact (Requires Attunement)\n\nThe Crown of Horns contains the essence and intelligence of Myrkul, one of the Dead Three. This ghastly crown is a pale silver circlet with four curved bones set around its rim. On the crown\u0027s brow is set a black diamond whose depths swirl with weird, malignant energy.\n\nMyrkul created the Crown of Horns at the height of his power. When Myrkul was slain by Mystra, he imbued the crown with his dying essence. Myrkul has since returned to become one of the Dead Three, and the Crown of Horns continues to further his gruesome will by seeking out mortal agents and gradually transforming them into powerful Undead scions. Should a wearer prove unworthy of this honor, the crown teleports away to find a new mortal to corrupt for its master.\n\nCursed. The crown is cursed. Attuning to the crown extends the curse to you. Only a Wish spell or the will of Myrkul can remove this curse. As long as you remain cursed, the following properties apply to you:\n\nBound. You are unwilling to part with the crown, wearing it at all times, and you can\u2019t voluntarily end your Attunement to the crown.\n\nCruel. Your alignment becomes Neutral Evil.\n\nDoomed. You slowly transform into a monstrous servant of Myrkul over the course of 365 days. During that time, the transformation is purely cosmetic; these cosmetic changes slowly fade if you end Attunement to the crown before completing the transformation. When the transformation is complete, you become a Lich under the DM\u2019s control. Each time you use this Artifact\u2019s Cone of Undeath or Myrkul\u2019s Hand benefit, there is a 10 percent cumulative chance that you instantly complete this transformation.\n\nCone of Undeath. You can take a Magic action to unleash a wave of unholy light in a 60-foot Cone. Each creature in the Cone makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 4d8 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Humanoid killed by Cone of Undeath rises at the start of your next turn as a Specter that follows your verbal orders.\n\nDamage Immunity. You have Immunity to Necrotic damage.\n\nFear Aura. While wearing the crown, you emit an aura of terrifying energy in a 60-foot Emanation. A creature that enters this area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition. A Frightened target must use its movement on its turns to get as far away as possible from you, moving by the safest route.\n\nIf you damage a Frightened target or if a Frightened target ends its turn more than 120 feet away from you, the target can repeat the Wisdom save, ending the condition on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on the save against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which it can be affected again.\n\nThe aura is inactive while you have the Incapacitated condition. You can activate or deactivate the aura as a Bonus Action.\n\nMyrkul\u2019s Hand. While wearing the crown, you can cast the Power Word Kill spell (save DC 18) from it. A Humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a Wraith that follows your verbal orders. Once you use the crown to cast this spell, you can\u2019t cast it again from the crown until the next dawn.\n\nTeleportation. While wearing the crown, you can cast the Teleport spell. The crown can also cast this spell of its own free will. Once the spell has been cast using the crown, it can\u2019t be cast again until 7 days have passed.\n\nRandom Properties. The Artifact has the following random properties (see chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide):\n\nSentience. The Crown of Horns is a sentient Neutral Evil Artifact with an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet.\n\nThe crown communicates telepathically with its wearer and knows Common.\n\nPersonality. The crown contains the essence of Myrkul and exists to spread that god\u2019s will, which is to slay the living, raise the dead, and sow fear across the Material Plane. The crown urges its wearer to spread dread and destruction wherever possible.\n\nDestroying the Crown. The crown is destroyed if it is worn by Myrkul\u2019s successor, Kelemvor, while he sits on the throne of Myrkul\u2019s former realm, the Bone Castle.",

The tome recounts both the oldest and most current profanities of the Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to censor the text, and while sections have been ripped from the book\u2019s spine, the general chapters remain, ever revealing demonic secrets. Caged behind lines of script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many pages are removed, and it longs to be more than mere reference material.\n\nAbyssal Lore. You can reference the Demonomicon whenever you make an Intelligence check to discern information about demons or a Wisdom (Survival) check related to the Abyss. When you do so, you gain Advantage on the check.\n\nContainment. The first ten pages of the Demonomicon are blank. As a Magic action while holding the book, you can target a Fiend that you can see that is trapped within the area of a Magic Circle spell. The Fiend must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw with Disadvantage or become trapped within one of the Demonomicon\u2019s blank pages, which fills with writing detailing the trapped creature\u2019s widely known name and depravities. Once used, this action can\u2019t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nWhen you finish a Long Rest, if you and the Demonomicon are on the same plane of existence, one trapped creature within the book can attempt to possess you. You make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you are possessed by the creature, which controls you like a puppet. As a Magic action, the possessing creature can release you and appear in the closest unoccupied space to you. On a successful save, the Fiend can\u2019t try to possess you again for 7 days (but another Fiend trapped in the book can certainly try).\n\nWhen the tome is discovered, it has 1d4 Fiends occupying its pages\u2014typically an assortment of demons.\n\nEnsnarement. While carrying the book, whenever you cast Magic Circle naming only Fiends or cast Planar Binding targeting a Fiend, the spell is cast at level 9, regardless of what level spell slot you used, if any. Additionally, the Fiend has Disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell.\n\nFiendish Scourging. While carrying the book, when you make a damage roll for a spell you cast against a Fiend, you use the maximum possible result instead of rolling.\n\nRandom Properties. The Artifact has the following random properties (see \u201CArtifacts\u201D):\n\nSpells. The book has 8 charges and regains 1d8 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the book, you can take a Magic action to cast one of the spells (save DC 20) on the following table. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.\n\nDestroying the Demonomicon. To destroy the book, six different demon lords must each tear out a sixth of the book\u2019s pages. If this occurs, the pages reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours pass, anyone who opens the book\u2019s remaining binding is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this deadly, semisentient domain lies a long-lost Artifact, Fraz-Urb\u2019luu\u2019s Staff. If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and out-of-date copy of the Tome of Zyx, the work that served as the foundation of the Demonomicon of Iggwilv.

    "Description": "Wondrous Item, Artifact (Requires Attunement)\n\nVecna was a mighty wizard who, through magic and conquest, forged a terrible empire. For all his power, however, Vecna feared death and took steps to prevent his demise by becoming a lich.\n\nA treacherous lieutenant named Kas brought Vecna\u2019s rule to an end in a terrible battle. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly Artifacts that still seek to work Vecna\u2019s will in the world.\n\nThe Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are separate Artifacts that might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a shriveled left extremity.\n\nRandom Properties of the Eye and Hand. The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna each have the following random properties (see \u201CArtifacts\u201D):\n\nAttuning to the Eye. To attune to the eye, you must press it into your empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. If the eye is ever removed, you die.\n\nProperties of the Eye. While you are attuned to the eye, your alignment is Neutral Evil, and you gain the following benefits:\n\nTruesight. You have Truesight out to 240 feet.\n\nSpellcasting. The eye has 8 charges and regains 1d4 \u002B 4 expended charges daily at dawn. You can cast a spell on the Eye of Vecna Spells table from the eye (save DC 18). The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell. Each time you cast a spell from the eye, there is a 5 percent chance that Vecna tears your soul from your body, devours it, and then takes control of the body like a puppet. If that happens, you become an NPC under the DM\u2019s control.\n\nX-ray Vision. You can take a Magic action to gain X-ray vision with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don\u2019t prevent light from passing through themselves. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.\n\nAttuning to the Hand. To attune to the hand, you must press it against the stump where your left hand was. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.\n\nProperties of the Hand. When you are attuned to the hand, your alignment is Neutral Evil, and you gain the following benefits:\n\nGreat Strength. Your Strength becomes 20 unless it is already 20 or higher.\n\nIcy Touch. Any melee spell attack you make with the hand and any melee attack made with a weapon held by it deals an extra 2d8 Cold damage on a hit.\n\nSpellcasting. The hand has 8 charges and regains 1d4 \u002B 4 expended charges daily at dawn. You can cast a spell on the Hand of Vecna Spells table from the hand (save DC 18). The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell. Each time you cast a spell from it, the hand casts Suggestion on you (save DC 18; no Concentration required), demanding that you commit an evil act. The hand might have a specific act in mind or leave it up to you.\n\nProperties of the Eye and Hand. While attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain the following additional benefits:\n\nDanger Sense. You have Advantage on Initiative rolls.\n\nNecrotic Reduction. As a Magic action, you can target one creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself. The target makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 7d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage is transformed into green slime (see chapter 3) that covers the ground in its space, each 5-foot square of slime representing a separate patch. Nonmagical objects worn or carried by the target that are made of metal or organic material are destroyed by the slime.\n\nPoison Immunity. You have Immunity to Poison damage and the Poisoned condition.\n\nRegeneration. If you start your turn with at least 1 Hit Point, you regain 1d10 Hit Points.\n\nWish. You can cast Wish. Once used, this property can\u2019t be used again until 30 days have passed.\n\nDestroying the Eye and Hand. If the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are both attached to the same creature and that creature is slain by the Sword of Kas, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the Artifact reappears in one of Vecna\u2019s many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered.",

    "Description": "Wondrous Item, Artifact (Requires Attunement)\n\nLong ago, in the Dragonlance setting, elves and humans waged a terrible war against chromatic dragons. When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and forged five Orbs of Dragonkind to help defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.\n\nAs the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped over the centuries. Their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, but they also allow some measure of control over dragons.\n\nEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those who try to wield an orb\u2019s magic but lack sufficient force of personality might find themselves under the orb\u2019s control.\n\nAn orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.\n\nWhile attuned to an orb, you can take a Magic action to peer into the orb\u2019s depths. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed save, the orb imposes the Charmed condition on you for as long as you remain attuned to it.\n\nWhile you are Charmed by the orb, you can\u2019t voluntarily end your Attunement to it, and the orb casts Suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular society or organization, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the DM decides.\n\nRandom Properties. An Orb of Dragonkind has the following random properties (see \u201CArtifacts\u201D):\n\nSpells. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 \u002B 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.\n\nCall Dragons. While you control the orb, you can take a Magic action to cause the orb to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Chromatic dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Chromatic dragons drawn to the orb might be Hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can\u2019t be used again for 1 hour.\n\nDestroying an Orb. An Orb of Dragonkind has AC 20 and is destroyed if it takes damage from a \u002B3 Weapon or a Disintegrate spell. Nothing else can harm it.",

When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and forged five \u003Cem\u003EOrbs of Dragonkind\u003C/em\u003E to help defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped over the centuries. Their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, but they also allow some measure of control over dragons.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those who try to wield an orb\u2019s magic but lack sufficient force of personality might find themselves under the orb\u2019s control.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAn orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile attuned to an orb, you can take a Magic action to peer into the orb\u2019s depths. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed save, the orb imposes the Charmed condition on you for as long as you remain attuned to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile you are Charmed by the orb, you can\u2019t voluntarily end your Attunement to it, and the orb casts \u003Ca href=\u0022/spell:suggestion\u0022\u003ESuggestion\u003C/a\u003E on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular society or organization, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the DM decides.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERandom Properties.\u003C/strong\u003E An \u003Cem\u003EOrb of Dragonkind\u003C/em\u003E has the following random properties (see \u201CArtifacts\u201D):\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E2 minor beneficial properties\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E1 minor detrimental property\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E1 major detrimental property\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESpells.\u003C/strong\u003E The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 \u002B 3 expended charges daily at dawn.

    "Description": "Weapon (Longsword), Artifact (Requires Attunement)\n\nKas was a powerful warrior who served Vecna and whose loyalty was rewarded with this sword. As Kas\u2019s power grew, so did his hubris. The sword urged Kas to destroy Vecna and usurp his throne. Legend says Vecna\u2019s destruction came at Kas\u2019s hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant\u2019s doom, leaving only Kas\u2019s sword behind.\n\nBloodthirst. The sword thirsts for blood. If the sword doesn\u2019t taste blood on its blade within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder makes a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder takes 3d6 Psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the Dominate Monster spell, and the sword demands blood. The spell effect ends when the sword\u2019s demand is met.\n\nMagic Weapon. You gain a \u002B3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with the sword, which scores a Critical Hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20 and deals an extra 2d10 Slashing damage to Undead.\n\nRandom Properties. The sword has the following random properties (see \u201CArtifacts\u201D):\n\nSpells.

While the sword is on your person, you gain the following benefits:\n\nBattle Hunger. You add 1d10 to your Initiative rolls.\n\nBlade of Defense. When you take an action to attack with the sword, you can transfer some or all of its attack bonus to your Armor Class instead. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn.\n\nNecrotic Resistance. You have Resistance to Necrotic damage.\n\nSentience. The Sword of Kas is a sentient Chaotic Evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet.\n\nThe weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Common.\n\nPersonality. The sword\u2019s purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna\u2019s worshipers, destroying the lich\u2019s works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal.\n\nThe Sword of Kas also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the Eye and Hand of Vecna.\n\nDestroying the Sword. A creature attuned to both the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna can use the Wish property of those combined Artifacts to unmake the Sword of Kas, provided the sword is within 30 feet of the spell\u2019s caster. Upon casting Wish, the creature makes a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, nothing happens, and the Wish spell is wasted. On a successful save, the Sword of Kas is destroyed.",

The wand can magically change in size to better conform to the grip of its user. All Holy Water within 10 feet of the wand is destroyed.\n\nAny creature besides Orcus that tries to attune to the wand makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 Necrotic damage. On a failed save, the creature dies and, if it is a Humanoid, turns into a Zombie.\n\nMagic Weapon. You can wield the wand as a magic Mace that grants a \u002B3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. The wand deals an extra 2d12 Necrotic damage on a hit.\n\nRandom Properties.

You gain a \u002B3 bonus to Armor Class while holding the wand.\n\nSpells. The wand has 7 charges and regains 1d4 \u002B 3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the wand, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it (save DC 18). The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.\n\nWhile attuned to the wand, Orcus or a follower blessed by him can cast each of the wand\u2019s spells using 2 fewer charges (minimum of 0).\n\nCall Undead. While holding the wand, you can take a Magic action to conjure 15 Skeletons and 15 Zombies. These Undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your commands until they are destroyed or until the next dawn, when they collapse into inanimate piles of bones and rotting corpses. Once you use this property, you can\u2019t use it again until the next dawn.\n\nWhile holding the wand, Orcus can summon any kind of Undead, not just skeletons and zombies. These Undead don\u2019t perish at dawn the following day, remaining until Orcus dismisses them.\n\nSentience. The Wand of Orcus is a sentient Chaotic Evil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and Darkvision out to 120 feet.\n\nThe wand communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Abyssal and Common.\n\nPersonality. The wand\u2019s purpose is to help satisfy Orcus\u2019s desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The wand is cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor.\n\nTo further Orcus\u2019s goals, the wand feigns devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus.\n\nDestroying the Wand. Destroying the Wand of Orcus requires that it be taken to the Positive Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life\u2014no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned the hero\u2019s soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded.\n\nBathing the wand in positive energy (such as that which permeates the Positive Plane) causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly re-forms on Orcus\u2019s layer of the Abyss.",
