    "Description": "Created by the god Corellon, the first elves could change their forms at will. They lost this ability when Corellon cursed them for plotting with the deity Lolth, who tried and failed to usurp Corellon\u0027s dominion. When Lolth was cast into the Abyss, most elves renounced her and earned Corellon\u2019s forgiveness, but that which Corellon had taken from them was lost forever.\n\nNo longer able to shape-shift at will, the elves retreated to the Feywild, where their sorrow was deepened by that plane\u2019s influence. Over time, curiosity led many of them to explore other planes of existence, including worlds in the Material Plane.\n\nElves have pointed ears and lack facial and body hair. They live for around 750 years, and they don\u0027t sleep but instead enter a trance when they need to rest. In that state, they remain aware of their surroundings while immersing themselves in memories and meditations.\n\nAn environment subtly transforms elves after they inhabit it for a millennium or more, and it grants them certain kinds of magic. Drow, high elves, and wood elves are examples of elves who have been transformed thus.\n\nDrow typically dwell in the Underdark and have been shaped by it. Some drow individuals and societies avoid the Underdark altogether yet carry its magic. In the Eberron setting, for example, drow dwell in rainforests and cyclopean ruins on the continent of Xen\u0027drik.\n\nHigh elves have been infused with the magic of crossings between the Feywild and the Material Plane. On some worlds, high elves refer to themselves by other names. For example, they call themselves sun or moon elves in the Forgotten Realms setting, Silvanesti and Qualinesti in the Dragonlance setting, and Aereni in the Eberron setting.\n\nWood elves carry the magic of primeval forests within themselves. They are known by many other names, including wild elves, green elves, and forest elves. Grugach are reclusive wood elves of the Greyhawk setting, while the Kagonesti and the Tairnadal are wood elves of the Dragonlance and Eberron settings, respectively.\n\nElves in the realm of Lorwyn-Shadowmoor possess black, pupilless eyes; curved horns; legs that end in cloven hooves; and pointed ears. The elves of Lorwyn exhibit stark differences physically as well as culturally from their Shadowmoor counterparts.\n\nThe horns of Lorwyn elves are stubby like a goat\u2019s or curved like a ram\u2019s, but always ridged. Their pointed ears are long and slender.\n\nIn Lorwyn, elves value beauty above all, though what any given elf deems beautiful can seem arbitrary. Some Lorwyn elves assume authority over the land\u2019s other peoples, using their fallen empire to support their claims.\n\nThese elves blame the fall of their empire on outside threats, especially the Phyrexian invasion. Though the invasion was the empire\u2019s death knell, its people\u2019s self-importance and unwillingness to collaborate with other species had already led to the empire\u2019s decline.\n\nShadowmoor elves\u2019 horns are long, wavy, and covered with a rough, thorny texture. Their pointed ears are usually longer than those of their Lorwyn counterparts.\n\nLike Lorwyn elves, Shadowmoor elves protect beauty, though a Shadowmoor elf\u2019s definition of \u201Cbeautiful\u201D can be abstract. Many of their kind believe beauty is gained or lost in accordance with one\u2019s actions; in particular, they consider heroism and self-sacrifice the highest forms of beauty.\n\nBloomseekers are Shadowmoor elves who study and explore Lorwyn. Each one carries a Reliquary of Twilight. Alongside Safewrights - Shadowmoor elves who venture across their realm in search of beautiful things - Bloomseekers are among the most trusted and revered members of their society.",

Boggarts tend to love crafting potions and commonly gravitate to specific areas of expertise, as noted in the sections below.\n\nBoggarts in Lorwyn are born into communal warrens where laws and hierarchies are considered suggestions. The oldest and most powerful boggarts, known as \u201Caunties,\u201D serve as respected leaders who keep the peace. Lorwyn boggarts value sharing knowledge and past experiences with their communities. Many are willing to brave great dangers in pursuit of new experiences, and adventurers are common.\n\nLorwyn boggarts also have a knack for magic. Boggarts who feel drawn to learning and using these natural affinities often become Druids. A Lorwyn boggart might alternatively find a calling as a Ranger, especially the Fey Wanderer subclass, or as a Wizard, especially the Diviner subclass, as boggarts have proven fond of ascertaining information through divination magic.\n\nBoggarts in Shadowmoor generally have sharper physical features than Lorwyn boggarts, including additional sets of horns. They are also known for body modifications, such as riveting armored plates to their flesh. Shadowmoor boggart society is chaotic and decentralized; their communities are few and likely to be found in isolated or dangerous environments. Aunties in Shadowmoor wander the lands, greeting those they meet with arbitrary tests, boons, or even curses.\n\nLike their Lorwyn counterparts, Shadowmoor boggarts are drawn to magic. These boggarts might become Warlocks, particularly leaning toward the Archfey Patron subclass; some might believe their patron is Isilu. Others prove to be Sorcerers and are especially likely to manifest their power in the form of the Wild Magic Sorcery subclass.\n\nCreature Type. You are a Humanoid. You are also considered a goblinoid for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a goblinoid.\n\nSize. You are Small (about 2\u20134 feet tall).\n\nSpeed. Your walking speed is 30 feet.\n\nAs a Boggart, you have these special traits.\n\nDarkvision.

The extra damage equals your proficiency bonus.\nYou can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest, and you can use it no more than once per turn.\n\nNimble Escape. You can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of your turns.",

Regardless of their origins, dhampirs exhibit their vampiric nature in various ways, including increased speed and a life-draining bite.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3 id=\u0022toc0\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EDhampir Traits\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECreature Type:\u003C/strong\u003E Humanoid\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESize:\u003C/strong\u003E Medium (about 4\u20137 feet tall) or Small (about 2\u20134 feet tall), chosen when you select this species\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESpeed:\u003C/strong\u003E 35 feet\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a Dhampir, you have these special traits.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDarkvision.\u003C/strong\u003E You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESpider Climb.\u003C/strong\u003E You have a Climb Speed equal to your Speed.
